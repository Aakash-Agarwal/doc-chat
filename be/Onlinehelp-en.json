In addition to a few direct links, the Home tab also offers a number of overview tables.\n\n===Overview tables===\nThe following overview tables are supported on the Home page:\n\n;* My applicants for assessment \n:The top table on the Home page shows the manager all the applications that they have not yet evaluated, sorted by their date of arrival. \n\n;* My jobs \n: This brief overview of jobs shows all active jobs that are assigned to the manager. The following columns are displayed for each job:\n:* Visitors: Number of visitors to the job posting\n:* Applicants: Total number of applicants to the job\n:* Released: Applications that have been released to me (linked)\n:* Top (HR): Number of applicants with an evaluation from HR for which the weight is greater than 80. \n:: [[File:Info.gif‎]] Specify a weight greater or less than 80 for each o the selection values in the “Overall evaluation” selection list.\n:* Status overview: Square for each status, with a darker color indicating more applicants in a given status.

The icon in the last column indicates a group appointment with multiple participants.\n\n;* Next steps\n: In this block, the manager can take the next steps relating to hiring and/or applicant processing. The following collection of links can be of use here:  \n:* Create new job requisition\n:: The manager can [[Create new staffing request|create a new job requisition]].\n:* My jobs\n:: Overview of all the manager’s jobs  \n:* All my direct report jobs\n:: Overview of all the manager’s jobs for which the manager has direct responsibility.\n:* All my jobs as alternate\n:: Overview of all the manager’s jobs for which the manager is serving as an alternate. \n:* Applications that have not yet been assessed \n:: Overview of applications that have not yet been assessed.\n:* Applications that have not yet been assessed by me\n:: By clicking on this link, the manager can see an overview in the [[Access for line manager#APPLICATIONS|Applications]] tab of the applications for which they have not yet provided an assessment.  \n\n;* Current \n: This block contains currently active topics, e.g.\n:* Applications to these jobs \n\n;* My Profile\n: The manager has various links to choose from in this block, and can modify their profile or change their password.\n:* Modify my profile\n:: Redirects to the [[Access for line manager#MY PROFILE|MY PROFILE]] tab.

In addition to [[Superior evaluation#Hiring manager view|viewing application documents]], (alternate) hiring managers also have access to a number of possible actions (see next section). \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note'''\n:It is '''not recommended''' that hiring managers edit or modify the application status.

In particular, accessible software ensures that users with disabilities have unrestricted access to all important functions of the software. \nAs part of the continuous improvements being made to functionality within the Umantis Applicant Management and Employee Management solutions, adjustments are also constantly being made with regard to accessibility. \n\nFor example, the following improvements have been added to Umantis Applicant Management and Employee Management: \n* A first set of [[Diagrams / Dashboards / Charts|diagrams]] have been redesigned for use with screen readers. \n* The [[Languages|language]] in use on the requested page is initialized so that screen readers can read the text in the displayed language.\n* Images are no longer used as navigation elements. Their URLs are therefore no longer read out by screen readers. \n* Elements can be reached by using the keyboard, even without a mouse. One aspect of this configuration is that an access key (= the “m” character) can now be used to select [[Multiple actions|multiple actions]] in the overview. A detailed explanation of how access keys are controlled in different browsers can be found [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp here].\n\nIn addition, the following modifications have been made in Umantis Applicant Management: \n* The date/time picker has been redesigned to provide support in entering times as well, thereby contributing to increased accessibility. \n* In order to facilitate the creation of accessible [[Create advertisement layout|publication and print designs]] for events, a new example template has been added in the online help.

That is, [[User roles in Applicant Management#Company-internal users|managers]] who have Umantis login data and have been assigned to this [[Job description (applicant management)#Responsibilities|job]] can then view and evaluate this [[Application documents|application]]. The same is true for all assigned '''alternate managers'''. All of them can either edit the manager’s main assessment, or else enter an additional assessment.  \n\nAt the same time as you release the application, you can also send the managers an [[Send email from template|email]] and inform them of the new application. This is especially useful if managers do not log in to Umantis regularly. The email is also sent to all alternate managers in CC. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] You can also release an application to the manager from the [[Superior evaluation|Manager assessment]] tab in the application documents.\n\n=====Important note=====\n\n* An email is sent to the responsible manager, with the alternate manager in CC, when the action is executed in the applicant overview for a job or in the global overview of all applications. \n\n* If the action is executed from the job-specific applicant overview, the manager (and alternate manager) is notified with exactly one email — even if multiple applicants were selected. However, if the same action is executed from the global applicant overview, then a separate email is sent for each applicant, even if multiple applicants are assigned to the same job.\n\n* If an application is released to the manager from the [[Superior evaluation|Manager assessment]] tab, '''no email''' is triggered and the application’s status is '''not changed'''.\n\n* Note also that the email is only sent to the alternate manager if you have <u>not</u> entered a '''redirection address'''. Especially in the introductory phase, most customers have entered a redirection address to avoid accidentally sending out emails that are generated during the setup phase. In order to test the desired action with CC copies to the alternate manager, you must first remove the redirection address.\n\n* For [[Unsolicited application|unsolicited applications]] and applications for a job with '''no''' manager assigned, the application status is not changed, and no emails are sent.\n\n*  Note that [[Change process status|changing the application status]] to “Manager evaluation” automatically releases the application for the manager view.\n\n=====Note=====\n* Corresponding actions are available as multiple actions in the [[Applications / Applicants overview|Application overview]]. There, you can also see at any time which applications have already been released.\n* If you send the email from the applicant overview for a job, only one mail will be generated. The manager sees in their cockpit that they have multiple applications to assess. If the email is generated from the global overview of all applications, the manager will receive one mail for each application that had a checkmark.\n\n==Remove from manager view==\nWith the action “''Remove from manager view''”, the selected applications are explicitly taken back out of the manager view.\n\n=====Note=====\n* Once an application has been '''archived''' (historized), it is <u>no longer displayed</u> in the manager view.\n* Whether an application is no longer displayed in the manager view does <u>not</u> depend on its '''application status'''. In other words, regardless of whether an application has the status ''Declined'' or ''Hired'', for example, the corresponding application will still be displayed in the manager view as long as it has not been historized or explicitly removed from the manager view.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Please note:''' It is considered valid behavior for committee members (as opposed to managers) to still be able to view [[Archive / activate application(s)|archived]] applicants.

Instead, companies are placing an increasing emphasis on an active search for talent, and thus for potential candidates. The Active Sourcing module in Umantis helps you in your search for suitable applicant profiles — both within your Umantis [[Applications / Applicants overview|applicant pool]] and on [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]] and [[XING|XING]].<br>\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Reach out to your contact at Umantis if you too are interested in this module and want to start actively searching for suitable applicants for your vacant posts. \n\n__TOC__\n==Important information and settings==\nTake note of the following information and tips to ensure that settings for branch offices and users are correctly configured in your Umantis Applicant Management solution.\n\n===Legal information===\nThe Umantis settings for “[[Data protection policy & data release|Privacy policy statement & data release]]” should be configured appropriately for the legal jurisdiction in which a given branch office is located. Please note that you and/or the administrator for your solution are responsible for configuring these correctly. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] The data release settings are of critical importance for use with Active Sourcing. In areas governed by European law, a data release from the applicant is strictly required. Therefore, the basic setting for “''Active release by applicant not required''” (in the [[Branches#Basic information|branch office profile]]) should '''not''' be active if the give branch office is subject to European law or equivalent legislation.\n\n===Applications and data release===\nApplications from Umantis [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]] are only through the Active Sourcing module if the applicant has agreed in the application form to release their data, and has not requested that their data be explicitly deleted after the application process is complete.

This allows certain applicant data to be retained beyond the legally specified data retention period, e.g. so that they can be used for statistical purposes. Functionally speaking, anonymizing an application falls somewhere between archiving it and deleting it. From the applicant’s and the HR expert's point of view, the application is effectively deleted. However, anonymized applications can still be analyzed via reports.\n\n==How are applications anonymized?==\nTo anonymize applications, use any of the following options:\n* Through the multiple action menu in the [[Applications / Applicants overview|applicant overview]]\n* In the actions at the left side under [[Application documents|Application documents]]\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' <br>\nAnonymizing actions always apply at the '''application level''', and '''not''' at the '''applicant level'''. Therefore, applicants themselves cannot be anonymized, but only the data associated with them. <br>\nOnly if '''all''' of an applicant's applications have been anonymized is the applicant as a person also anonymized.\n\n==[[File:Attention.gif]] Important notes on anonymizing applications==\n\n* When an application is anonymized, all personally-identifiable information is deleted, along with any documents, messages, comments and reminders associated with the application. The application is also automatically '''historized'''. The applicant’s name is automatically replaced by a code.\n* Once an application has been anonymized, the original data can no longer be viewed, even after reactivation.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> \n[[File:checkmark.gif]] '''Anonymization rules/notes through December 2017/January 2018:'''<br> The anonymization process will be redesigned on December 19, 2017 (Beta) and on January 9, 2018 (Stable). <br>Therefore, please note that the following rules/notes still apply to applications received and anonymized prior to those dates: <br>(''Click on “Expand”'') <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n* If an applicant has a '''job alert subscription''', then anonymization will cause all personally identifiable information to be deleted except for the person’s ''email address'' and ''login name''. The applicant still actively requires this profile-related information to manage their job alert subscription.\n* Note that such data are only deleted or made unrecognizable in the applicant’s profile when '''all applications for the person in question have been anonymized'''. Since an applicant may have '''multiple applications''' in the system at different times and for different branch offices, sensitive data about the person cannot be globally anonymized (for all branch offices and all applications). Therefore, if an applicant has multiple applications in the system (for multiple branch offices), then any one specific anonymization action will only anonymize the data found in the specific application targeted by that action. Personally-identifiable information found in the applicant’s profile (e.g. last name, first name, etc.) are only anonymized when all applications for this applicant have been anonymized.\n</div> </div>\n<br>\n\n==How do I search for an anonymized application?==\nAnonymized applications are explicitly marked as \"IsAnonymized\" with an icon: [[File:IsAnonymized.PNG|20px]] (independent of their historized/active status). The “IsAnonymized” flag is accessible through a variable ([Application.IstAnonymisiert]). You can search for anonymized applications either in the '''advanced search''' or in the '''global applicant overview'''.\n\n==What data are anonymized?==\nAll sensitive, personally-identifiable applicant data will be permanently deleted. Structured, non-personally-identifiable data is retained for use in statistics and analytics. \nStructured data consists of values made available for selection through selection lists. The following table lists all the relevant fields from the application form and application documents that are '''retained''' after anonymization is complete. All other application and applicant data from the HR expert view is considered sensitive, and is therefore '''deleted''' as part of the anonymization process.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> [[File:info.gif]] ''' Click on “Expand” to display the table.''' <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\nFirst and last name are anonymized.

These are - in contrast to the documents of the application - linked to the person and not to the application. This provides a central repository for the applicant's documents, no matter how often the person applies. Documents can be uploaded by the applicant as well as by users (HR or managers). The upload fields can be displayed in the following places: Applicant Cockpit (''/SelfService''), Applicant Dossier for HR users and Applicant Dossier for managers.

By default, the applicants always have to fill in the same fields, but application forms can also be customized [[Branches|for each branch office]].\nAn interface from the application form to [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]] is possible on both the [[Jobs (employee management)|internal job board]] and the [[Vacancies (applicant management)|external job board]].\n \n===[[File:attention.gif]] Important notes===\n* '''Certain fields in the application form should never be hidden''' (even if they appear multiple times). They are automatically controlled by branch office settings and the choice of login method. These fields include: \n:* Username (login name)\n:* Password\n:* User language\n:* Email address\n* '''Never use special characters, spaces, or characters with umlauts or accents''' in the names of the documents that you upload! This leads to errors that can and should be avoided.\n* Certain [[User roles in Applicant Management|user roles]] are authorized to configure the application forms. If you are using a company-specific custom URL (i.e. other than \"'''''recruitingapp-ID.umantis'''.''com\") for your Haufe solution, please note that the configuration of the application forms is only possible through the URL that you used to log in to the system.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Note on the '''''What else would you like to tell us?''''' section\n: The following fields can be used in the \"What else would you like to tell us?\" section of the application form, in order to record applicants' comments about themselves or about their application:\n:* '''Comments about the person''' \n:: The comments entered here are saved to the person's record. (Import variable: [Bewerbung.Anmerkungen])\n:* '''Comments about the application'''\n:: The comments entered here are saved to the application. (Import variable: [Bewerbung.AnmerkungenZurBewerbung])\n\n==Branch-specific application forms==\n[[Branches|Branch office-specific]] configuration of application forms allows for an individualized layout of fields on the application forms for each [[Branches|branch office]]. Changes can therefore be made as necessary for different legal jurisdictions.\n\nThe configurations of the application forms can be applied by the [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|administrator]] in the branch office settings for each [[Branches|branch office]]. There, the administrator can select the fields that are to be displayed or hidden in the application form for a job at this branch office. \n: US-compliant application forms: [[Dynamic questions#EEOC Questions|EEOC Questions]] \n\n''Notes:''<br>\n*[[File:Info.gif]] Please note that the fields in the branch office-specific form can only be displayed if they were both displayed globally through the use of [[Configuration mode|Configuration mode]], and also enabled in the branch office-specific configuration.\n*[[File:Info.gif]] In general, the password field in application forms may not be hidden. If you do not want to require the use of password, use the function [[Application forms#Application without login|Application without login]].\n*[[File:Info.gif]] If you want to use branch office-specific configurations, you must activate the setting to \"'''Enable branch office-specific settings'''\".\n*[[File:Info.gif]] The forms behave similarly for [[Unsolicited application|unsolicited applications]], i.e. if the applicant is on a branch office-specific job board, then the form is laid out according to the settings that have been entered for that [[Branches|branch office]].\n\n===Application without login===\nWhen the \"Application without login\" option is activated, the applicant is not required to enter a password, and providing an email address is only optional. Please pay attention to the notes under the [[Branches|Branch office settings]].\nActivate the \"Application without login\" option under: ''Settings > Branch offices > Select branch office > Settings tab > Application process > click on [[File:edit.GIF]]'' and check the box for \"Activate application without login\".\n\n[[File:Niederlassungspezifische Bewerbungsformulare.JPG|thumb|600px|Fig. 1: Configuration mode and branch office-specific settings define visibility]]\n{| class=\"wikitable justify\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 1\n|-\n|\nFirst, the application form fields for the given [[Branches|branch office]] are set up in the Settings. Only after a field is approved in one or both branch offices is it actually possible to display and hide the individual fields of the form in [[Configuration mode|Configuration mode]].\n|}\n===Overview of configurable fields===\nAll person— and application-specific fields that are relevant to creating an application can be configured. Examples include first name, last name, date of birth etc. Fields that relate to a job, such as job location in the case of unsolicited applications, are not configurable. Likewise, additional personal fields that are requested as part of the master data sheet, such as details regarding a partner or the applicant's bank details, are not available for branch office-specific customization.\n\n''Notes:''<br>\n*[[File:Info.gif]] The configuration supports only the display and hiding of fields on the form. Other changes, such as renamings, etc., cannot be applied to a specific branch office, and always apply globally.\n<br><br><br />\n===Overview of configuration-dependent forms===\nAll forms that can be used to enter an application are dependent on the configuration settings of the associated branch office. This applies both to applications that are created by an applicant (internal and external), and to applications that are created by third parties (such as the HR expert or a recruiter).\nFor detailed information about the ways in which forms can be configured, see [[Application form & application folder in Haufe applicant management system|Application forms & application documents in Haufe Applicant Management]].\n\n===Display in the application documents/master data sheet===\n[[File:Stammdatenblatt.JPG|thumb|480px|Fig. 2: The applicant's master data sheet displays fields for all branch offices combined.]]\nAn applicant's [[Application documents|application documents/master data sheet]] is designed to be [[Branches|the same for all branch offices]]. If an applicant has applied for multiple [[Vacancies (applicant management)|jobs]] at different [[Branches|branch offices]] within the company, then all fields that the applicant had to complete during the application process are displayed in the overview.\n\n*'''Example''':\n:If the Middle name field was requested in the application for the job at branch office A, but not in the application for the job at branch office B, all fields that were displayed in at least one job application (including \"Middle name\", in this example) are listed together in the [[Application documents|application documents/master data sheet]].\n{| class=\"wikitable justify\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 2\n|-\n|\nAn applicant has applied for one job at [[Branches|branch office]] A and another at [[Branches|branch office]] B. The forms for the two [[Branches|branch offices]] were configured specifically for each branch office. The application forms contain the following fields:\n* Form for branch office A: Contains fields 2, 3 and 6\n* Form for branch office B: Contains fields 2, 5 and 6\nIn the master data sheet, the applicant sees all fields displayed together, i.e. fields 2, 3, 5 and 6.\n|}\n\n\n<br>\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Application form & application folder in applicant management system|Application forms & application documents in Haufe Applicant Management]]\n* [[Dynamic questions|Dynamic questions]]\n* [[Branches|Branch offices]]\n* [[Register new application#Error messages and causes|Create new application — Error messages and their causes]]"

You are now in the \"Description\" tab for the selected job. Under the \"Actions\" header on the left side, you will see a link to \"Create applications for this job\". Click on this, and a new view will open.\n\nEnter the applicant's information. It is important to enter an email address. At the bottom of the view, you can attach documents (résumé, reference letters etc.). Finally, click Save.\n\nThe application is now entered in the system and can be clicked on in the \"Applicant overview\" tab in the detailed view for the job.\n\n===Email application===\nAs with an application by letter, you must first [[Register new application|create an application]] for the job in question. You then have the option to import your email into Haufe using the [[Outlook plugin|Outlook plugin]].\nImported emails are assigned directly to the user (in the Communication area) by using the applicant's email address. If the email cannot be assigned, it is displayed under “Communication” — “Unassigned emails & letters”.\n\nWhen you open an imported email, various options for further processing are displayed in the \"Actions\" section at the left. For example, you can click on the link ''Assign new targeted application to job'' from the unassigned email to create a new application for a job.\n\n===Online application===\nApplicants can apply for a job online in Haufe Applicant Management by clicking on the desired job posting, then clicking on the link labeled \"I am interested and would like to apply\" under \"Actions\" at the bottom of the job description. They can now enter their application and attach documents. After creating the application and answering any [[Dynamic questions#Selection questions for applicants|job-specific questions]] that may be asked, applicants will receive an automatic confirmation by email. They can modify their information and documents at any time, and apply for other jobs.\n\nOr, they can create an unsolicited application. This means that they are not applying for a specific advertised job, but to this company in general. The unsolicited application link can be activated separately for each [[Branches |branch office]].\n\nIf an applicant would like to apply for more than one job, the documents from the previous application are automatically reused. Either the full application or just the associated documents can thus be individually deleted without affecting other applications (for data protection purposes).\n\nAfter people have been applying to your advertised job for a certain period of time, the participating HR experts and hiring managers, as well as anyone else involved in the process, can make a selection based on the documents received.\n\n===Recruiter===\n[[Recruiter|Recruiters]] are external service providers who work with HR experts. They submit potential applicants for a vacancy to the HR experts. They have a dedicated access to Haufe Applicant Management, and can view the published jobs and create applications for them.\n\n==Incomplete applications==\nThe status \"Application incomplete\" is automatically set if the applicant quits after the first form (entering personal data), for example by closing the browser/tab before clicking on \"Submit application definitely\". If the application process is unintentionally interrupted while answering the questions, for example because the internet connection is interrupted or the browser is closed due to an error, the status is also set to \"Application incomplete\".\n* Applications in the \"Application incomplete\" status are not displayed directly in the Recruiter area. The applicant can view and edit his incomplete application in his cockpit for a certain time. \n* Incomplete applications are then only submitted overnight to the responsible HR department as incomplete. From this point on, the applicant can no longer edit this application.\n\nIf [[Dynamic questions|questions for the job]] (selection criteria) have been defined and the applicant clicks on \"'''Cancel'''' when answering these questions, a message will be displayed: <br>''Do you really want to cancel this application? Your application will be deleted. Provided you have no other current applications or job subscriptions, all personal data will also be deleted.'' <br>\n--> If the application process is then cancelled (via \"Cancel application\"), the '''application is definitely deleted'''. Otherwise, the answering of the questions can be continued via \"Back\" and the application can definitely be submitted.\n\nEmail notifications for various possible applicant statuses can be turned on and off in the [[Main settings|main settings]] for the given user under “[[Email#System emails|Email notifications]]”, and their content can be specifically customized under “[[System e-mails|System emails]]” in the [[Main settings|main settings]].\n\n==Forwarding applications==\nSo that all participants can assess or view applications, you can forward applications as desired. Check the box next to the applications that you would like to forward, and choose one of the following commands at the bottom of the table:\n* [[Activate for line manager area (and send email)|Activate for line manager area (and send email)]]\n* [[Activate for committees / retract committee access|Activate for committees / Retract committee access]]\n* [[Linking using emails in applicant management|Forward application documents to third party]]\n\n\n[[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_Oktober_2009-3.swf|Excerpt from webinar on forwarding applications (7 min)]]\n\n==Applicant preselection==\nIf a person has applied for a job online, this is displayed on the home page (\"New applications\" link). You can view the application and send an email to the applicant, thanking them for their application and asking for their patience (bearing in mind that the applicant will also have received an automatic email). You can do this by clicking on the \"New applications\" link on the home page, then checking the box next to the name of the person to whom you wish to send the email. At the bottom of the table, select the command \"Change status\" and \"[[Send email from template|Send email from template]]\", then click on \"Apply\". You can now assign a new status to the selected person. After saving the status change, select the appropriate template and click on \"Create\". You will now see the created email and can modify it however you like. Click “Send” to deliver the email to the applicant.\n\nIf you discover that documents are missing for a given applicant, you can also inform them of this in an email or by phone. Once the applicant has logged in to the system and made additional changes to their applicant profile, they will then receive a message and a link asking them to submit a brief description of their changes in a short form. You will then be informed by email (if this option is activated in your profile) of the changes made by the applicant. In addition, this application will be marked with an exclamation point (!) to indicate that it has been updated. A [[Applicant management main page#Suchlink|search link]] on the home page makes it easier to find updated applicant profiles.<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] Note: This system email will be sent to the responsible HR expert '''and''' to their alternate(s), if this option is activated in their respective profiles.\n\nIf you find that an application is inadequate, or that the applicant is not suited for this job, you can generate a message declining the person's application by following the above example and setting the application status (e.g. to \"Decline\") and send an email from a template. You can archive declined applications so that you will no longer see them in the course of your everyday work. \nAnother possibility is to prioritize applications based on answers to pre-defined [[Dynamic questions|questions]].\n\n==Assessing the application==\nPeople who receive a request by email to assess an application can click on the link they receive in order to enter their assessment. After everyone who is permitted to evaluate applications to a particular job has examined and compared the applicants' documents, an evaluation can be created. This evaluation is typed in and saved.\n\nAll evaluations can now be viewed and compared in the \"Applicant overview\" tab for the job or the applications. The column labeled \"HR assessment\" shows the evaluation of the responsible HR expert. The column labeled \"Feedback\" shows the evaluation of hiring managers, hiring team members and people with no login data.\n\nIn the \"Hiring manager assessment\" column, you can choose to display applications for which no assessment has been sent back yet since you sent them to the hiring manager. To display this overview, check the box for \"Open applications\" in the search bar at the left, and click on “Search”.\n \n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_Oktober_2009-2.swf|Excerpt from webinar on assessing applications (21 min)]]\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_Oktober_2009-4.swf|Excerpt from webinar on making and communicating a decision (22 min)]]\n\n==Further communication with applicant==\nAll communication with the applicant (for other applications too) can be found under \"Further communication with applicant\" in the communication overview for the application. <br>\n\n'''Note:''' Managers and HR experts will only see communications that relate to applications to which they have access.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] See also [[Communication history|Communication history]]\n\n==Search parameters==\n\n* '''?tracking_id=[ID]'''\n: Example: ?tracking_id=abc123 \n\n* '''?srcID=[ID]'''\n: Example: ?srcID=123\n\n* '''?srcText=[TEXT]'''\n: Example: ?srcText=abc\n\n==Tips and tricks==\n[[File:Info.gif]] Notes: \n* If [[Performance|performance problems]] occur when loading the applicant overview, use [[Configuration mode#Configure table|Configuration mode (configure tables)]] to reduce the number of rows displayed to 10. <br> \n* Be sure to also take note of any [[Register new application#Error messages and causes|error messages and their causes]].\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Create new speculative application|Create new unsolicited application]]\n* [[Register new application|Create new application (with no check for duplicates)]]\n\n==Multiple actions==\n[[File:info.gif]] The multiple actions available in the overview of all applications are listed below.

Note that you cannot send invitations for appointments that took place in the past.\n* '''Invite supervisors'''\n: Invite supervisors to the appointment. To send the invitation for the appointment, enter the email address and other information and then click on “Send invitation”.\n* '''Update appointment'''\n: Use this link to update the appointment. This action is displayed if “related people” have already been invited using the “Invite supervisors” action.\n: When updating an appointment, you can also use the [[Appointment scheduling wizard|appointment planning wizard]] (if it has been set up).\n* '''Cancel appointment'''\n: This action permanently deletes the appointment and removes it from the profiles of all invited applicants.

Both variations can be used at the same time: \n\n===Fixed appointments===\nCreate specific fixed appointments for a job. You can specify the exact date and time for the '''start''' and '''end''' of each appointment:\n* '''Appointment 1 start:''' (Date / Time)\n* '''Appointment 2 end:''' (Date / Time)\n* ''Appointment 3 start...''\n: [[File:info.gif]] You can create up to 5 fixed appointments.\n\n====Check availabilities====\nClick the “Check availabilities” button to launch the [[Appointment scheduling wizard|Appointment planning wizard]]. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] If the button is not displayed, or if the message “''Service unavailable''” appears, please check whether the interface settings have been correctly configured.\n\n===Dynamically created appointments===\n[[File:info.gif]] Dynamically created appointments allow for greater flexibility. In this case, you create a rule that simultaneously generates multiple appointments at regular intervals, beginning at the indicated start time. You must enter the following information for dynamically generated appointments: \n* '''Start time'''\n: If you do not enter a value here, no dynamically generated appointments can be created.\n* '''Number of appointments'''\n: If you do not enter a value, only 1 appointment will be created. The maximum number of appointments that can be created at once is 50. \n* '''Duration in minutes'''\n: If you do not enter a value here, no dynamically generated appointments can be created. Please enter integer values only, e.g. 120 for two hours. \n* '''Break length in minutes'''\n: When appointments are longer and there are several of them, it is recommended that you include a break between them. If you do not indicate a break length, then the appointments will be directly adjacent to one another. For example, if appointment 1 ends at noon, then appointment 2 will also begin at noon. \n* '''Latest time:''' (time)\n: If an appointment would go past this time, then the creation of additional appointments will continue on the next day, starting at the same start time. If an appointment is too long to fit between the indicated start time and latest time, then it cannot be created. \n* '''Skip weekday'''\n: Enter the weekday(s) that should be skipped: If the beginning of a subsequent appointment (when the number of appointments is greater than 1) would fall on one of the days specified here, then the creation of appointments will continue on the next available weekday. Holidays are not automatically detected. \n* '''Time zone'''\n: Indicate the time zone. (If no time zone is explicitly indicated here, the system will automatically detect the browser’s time zone and assign it to the user.)\n; More information\n* '''Confirmation allowed up to (days)'''\n: Enter the maximum number of days before the appointment that confirmation should still be allowed.  \n* '''Maximum number of participants'''\n: Enter the maximum number of participants allowed.\n* '''Maximum number of appointments of this type available for selection by each applicant:'''\t\n: The applicant may only confirm a certain number of available appointments for each appointment type. The restriction specified here is valid for all (current) appointments for a given job that take place in the future. Changing this number from a previous value here will cause all appointments of this type to be modified here. <br> '''Suggestion:''' We recommend that the number you specify be as close as possible to the number of appointments that the applicant is actually expected to attend. \n\n\n----\n* '''Notes'''\n: You can enter notes that will in appear in the applicant’s view. \n* '''Documents'''\n: If desired, you can attach documents that will in appear in the applicant’s view. \n\nOnce you have filled in all the information, click on “Save” and then on “Done”.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The next time an appointment is created for this job, certain information will be automatically filled in.\n</div></div>\n\n==Invite applicants to appointments for this job==\nInvite applicants to an appointment by opening the applicant overview for a job and [[Release appointments for selected applicant(s)|releasing appointments for the selected applicant(s)]].\n\n==Delete appointment for a job==\nIf you have created at least one appointment for a job, you will see a tabular overview with all the details of the appointments you have entered.

From here, you can ''confirm'' or ''cancel'' appointments assigned to the applicant, or ''remove'' the appointments. [[File:info.gif]] Appointments that took place in the past are indicated with the [[File:attention.gif]] icon.\n\n* '''Appointments for the linked job'''\n: If appointments have already been created for the job that is linked to this application (in accordance with the section [[#Termin zu einer Stelle erfassen|Create appointment for a job]]), a tabular overview will appear in the “Appointments for the linked job” section with details on each of the appointments that have been created. From here, you can assign appointments to the applicant (as described in the following section). [[File:info.gif]] Appointments that took place in the past are indicated with the [[File:attention.gif]] icon.\n\n==Linking the application with a new job when there are existing appointments==\nWhen assigning the applicant to the new job (action: ''Link applicant to another job''), you can decide whether the application is to be moved to another job with all its evaluations, or added as an additional non-evaluated application. <br> [[File:attention.gif]] If you have already assigned [[Appointments|appointments]] to applicants, they may be lost if the existing application is assigned to a new job. We recommend that you create a new/additional application so that you do not lose the existing application and the appointments already assigned.\n\n==Assign applicants to an appointment==\nIn the “Appointments” tab (in the detailed view of an application), you can use the tabular overview of all '''Appointments for the associated job''' to '''assign applicants''' to individual appointments. After clicking on this link, you will see a brief appointment overview for this application, with information about: \n\n'''Assigned appointments'''<br>\nIf appointments have already been assigned to this application, they are listed here according to their status (“Accepted”, “Declined” and “No reply”), with detailed information about the appointment:\n* Accepted / Declined / No reply\n\n'''New appointment'''<br>\nThe details of the new appointment that you are currently assigning to the application are displayed here. Before clicking on “Assign”, you can first set the '''application status''' and decide whether you want to [[Send email from template|send an email (from a template)]] to the applicant:\n* Type / Appointment \n* Application status \n* Send email\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Caution:''' Variables like [Course.Description], [Course.StartDate], [Course.EndDate] or [Course.Address] CANNOT be used here, since there is a 1:n relation between the (one) applicant to whom you are sending an email, and the applicant’s (multiple) appointments. These variables require a 1:1 relation, and can therefore only be used in the detailed view of an appointment. Alternatively, you can use a variable loop here over all appointments (without a reply) for this applicant."

In general, then, the hammer icon moves from top to bottom — provided that the approvers make their decisions in the same order in which they are contacted.  \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Notes:'''\n* '''The order of approvers cannot be changed after the approval process has started.'''\n* Requests for decisions are sent to each person by email. This email contains a specially generated link that takes the person to a decision form.\n\n==Important notice==\nFor security reasons, the default configuration of the system email template for vacancy approvals will no longer include an email parameter (change from calendar week 23). <br>\n'''>>''' The following URL section (in bold) '''has been removed''': <br>\n''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfServiceApprovals/Position/[Approval.StellenID]/Approval/[Approval.ID]?'''EmailParam=[Approval.LoginKey]&'''customer=[Customer.Name]&lang=ger&DesignID=[Design.ID]''\n\n===Modification of the system email template for vacancy approvals===\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please follow the following steps to modify your template to address the current security requirements, if you customized your email template for vacancy approvals: \n* Open the affected email template using the URL extension: \"''/Administration/SystemTemplates/19/Profile''”\n: (or via: “Main Settings” > “System Emails” tab > Click email template “Request for vacancy approval” (code: ''SystemTemplate_AskForApproval''))\n* If your template '''contains''' the following parameter, be sure to remove it: '''''EmailParam= [Approval.LoginKey]&'''''\n* Afterwards, the URL should look as follows: https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfServiceApprovals/Position/[Approval.StellenID]/Approval/[Approval.ID]?customer=[Customer.Name]&lang=ger&DesignID=[Design.ID]<br>\n: (For comparison, see the following URL containing the parameter mentioned above. This is '''considered a security risk''' as it allows automatic login to access your profile: ''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfServiceApprovals/Position/[Approval.StellenID]/Approval/[Approval.ID]?EmailParam=[Approval.LoginKey]&customer=[Customer.Name]&lang=ger&DesignID=[Design.ID]'')\n\nThis configuration prevents unauthorized access beyond an individual's granted access rights in case an email for vacancy approval is accidentally forwarded to an unauthorized person. Ignoring the instructions above for the removal of the parameter ('''''<nowiki>EmailParam=[Approval.LoginKey]&</nowiki>''''') creates a preventable security risk to personal data. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Any customization of system email templates (as well as any other custom configurations of the solution) is the responsibility of the customer. \n\n====When using SSO====\nIf you are using [[SSO - Single Sign On]], the system email sent during the approval process (Code: '''''SystemTemplate_AskForApproval''''' - Approval of vacancy) needs to be modified as follows:<br> ''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfServiceApprovals/Position/[Approval.StellenID]/Approval/[Approval.ID]?customer=[Customer.Name]&lang=ger&DesignID=[Design.ID]'''&v4login=sso'''''\n\n==Start and administer approval process==\n===Start approval process===\nAfter the approval process has been defined and set up, it can be started. A note field appears in which additional information can be added for approvers if necessary. The current state of the approval process can also be seen in the overview.\n\nThe '''job status''' changes to ''Approval process started''.\n\n===Reset and restart approval process===\nThis action resets all decisions already made in the approval process, and the process is started over from the beginning. This can be useful if no approval is received from a given approver, since the process can then be manually repeated. A system email is sent to the responsible HR expert to inform them that the process has been terminated.\n\n===Resume approval process===\nThis action only appears when an approver has declined to give their approval. When you choose to resume the approval process, it continues with the approver that had declined to give approval.\n\n===Add or remove people during an ongoing approval process===\nPeople can be added or removed at any time during an approval process. However, note that the approval process must be restarted after new approvers are added!\n\n===Edit or reset approval decisions===\nApproval decisions can be reset or edited and supplemented with comments after they are made.\n<br>\n====Resetting a decision====\nIf an approval decision is revoked (reset), the relevant person is asked to answer the approval request again.\n<br>\n===Resend approval request===\nIf the approver has already been contacted, but has not yet made a decision, the process comes to a halt at that point. The approver in question can therefore be contacted again with the “Resend approval request” action. You have the option to attach a new comment when sending the notification.\n<br>\n\n===Email notification after end of the approval process===\nWhen the approval process has ended and the job has been approved, then in addition to the responsible HR expert and hiring manager, the alternate HR expert and hiring manager (if any) are also automatically informed by email (in CC). Clicking on the link provided in the email displays an overview of the approvers’ comments and decisions.\n\n==Job status in the approval process==\n* Once the approval process has been started, the ''Job status'' changes to '''Approval process started'''.\n* When all approvers have approved a job, the job status changes to '''Approved'''.\n* If the job was not approved, then the job status changes to '''Declined'''.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Job description (applicant management)|Description]]\n* [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]\n* [[Selection lists|Selection lists]]\n* [[Publish vacancy|External job posting]]\n* [[Internal publication|Internal job posting]]\n* [[Applications / Applicants overview|Applicant overview]]\n* [[Appointments|Appointments]]\n* [[Assessment|Assessment]]\n* [[Reminders|Reminders]]\n\n==Actions==\n* Start / Resume / End approval process\n* Create reminder for this job"

The sequence of steps required is displayed, or the steps may even be triggered automatically. At every step, users can receive further guidance in the form of information.\n\nYou will find the Assistants area under [[Settings|Settings]]. The overview displays all the assistants that have been created. You can click an assistant to edit it. \n\n==Benefits of assistants==\n*  Better process quality\n*  Integrate new employees more quickly \n*  Navigate more efficiently\n*  Simple navigation in the solution \n*  Assistants are easy to customise\n\n==Create and edit an assistant==\n\nTo find out exactly to add [[Create new assistant#The elements of a step in the assistant|steps to an assistant]] and how they need to be structured, go to [[Create new assistant|Create new assistant]].\n\nThe overview of [[Create new assistant#The elements of a step in the assistant|steps in an assistant]] displays all the steps sorted in sequence. You can use the arrows [[File:ArrowDown.gif|ArrowDown.gif]],[[File:ArrowUp.gif?|ArrowUp.gif?]] to change the order. So, if you retrospectively want to add another interim step, it is first added at the bottom and you can then move it upwards.\n\n==Integrating assistants==\n\nAn assistant is opened via the URL \".../Wizard/ID\". An assistant's ID is output as \"No.\" in the overview. \n\n===Example Send a link to the assistant===\n\nYou can send the link to the assistant (wizard) and the recipients only have to click it for the assistant to guide them through umantis, e. g. an application process or initiate an employee review meeting.\n\n: <nowiki>http://employeeapp-[KUNDENID].umantis.com/Wizard/[NUMMER]</nowiki>\n\n\nReplace [CLIENTID] with your umantis ID, and the number of the wizard with the number of your assistant.\n\n===Example Integrate a link to the assistant on the main page===\n\nWould you like to add an assistant to the main page? If so, enter this link with your umantis ID and the title of the link by, under \"Customise view\", clicking the link which is to be inserted via the [[File:Config.gif|Config.gif]] and there: \n\nenter the name of the link in the FixedText English field and, in the Link Target field: \"/Wizard/[NUMBER]\"\n\nof, if no link target is provided, enter the entire link with HTML into the Original Content FixedText English field:\n\n: <nowiki>&lt;a href=\"https://employeeapp-[KUNDENID].umantis.com/Wizard/[NUMMER]\"&gt;Evaluation and Superior Approval&lt;/a&gt;</nowiki>\n\n\nLook beforehand to see the ID of the assistant you want.\n\n==Tips from consultants==\n\n[[File:Info.gif?|Info.gif?]] To start creating a new assistant, log into umantis twice; once as an admin in order to create the assistant, and once as a user to view the pages in question and to be able to copy the URLs without switching site. In this way you will also avoid including pages and views which are not accessible to non-administrators.\n\n===Pre-select multiple action===\n\nIn assistants, you can pre-select the action to be executed in overviews. To do so, you need to find out the 'value' of the multiple selection you want in the HTML code. Then enter this as the parameter \"MultiActionPreSelection\" in the assistant step.\n\nFor example, with the following link in the employees overview all the employees are selected and the action \"Send email(s) from template\" is pre-selected: /Employment/Current?searchLink=1&fas44001=1&checked44001=1&MultiActionPreSelection=PositionsList_Contact_SendEmail\n\n==Actions==\n*  [[Create new assistant|Create new assistant]]\n\n==Extracts from web seminars about assistants==\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-1.swf|General/Create a simple assistant (70 mins)]]\n\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-4.swf|Integration (25 mins)]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-3.swf|Second example (36 mins)]]\n\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-2.swf|Assistant with multiple entities (25 mins)]]\n\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-5.swf|Questions (14 mins)]]"

All automatic exports are prepared in XML or CSV format. \nThe technology used for this is completely different from the one used with [[Export templates|export templates]]. It must be set up by experts, and SQL SELECT queries are used instead of variables. This is the same technology as is used for [[Diagram templates|diagrams]] or [[Excel report templates|Excel report templates]], for example. You request a URL, and the system responds with an XML. You can use the GET or POST methods described below for these requests. \n\n==HTTP request methods: GET and POST==\nGET and POST requests have the following properties, advantages, and disadvantages.\n\n; GET methods\nWith the GET method, the parameters are submitted through the URL.\n\n: '''GET queries:'''\n::* can be cached\n::* stay in the browser history\n::* can be marked with bookmarks\n::* have length restrictions\n::* should only be used to fetch data\n\n; POST method\nWith the POST method, unlike the GET method, the parameters are '''not''' sent through the URL, but rather through a form/script. which is configured on the customer side. \n\n: '''POST queries:'''\n::* are not cached\n::* do not stay in the browser history\n::* cannot be bookmarked\n::* have no length restrictions\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:900px\"> '''Example form for a POST request:''' Click on “Expand” to see an example form...<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n <html>\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n <form action=\"https://recruitingapp-90063140.umantis.com/Exports/TestExport/85\" method=\"post\">\n submit \n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"Key\" value=\"yourkey\">\n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"PlattformID\" value=\"98060\">\n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"LangID\" value=\"1\">\n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"CustomerID\" value=\"90063140\">\n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"Lang\" value=\"de\">\n <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"OrganisationsID\" value=\"\">\n <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n </form> \n </body>\n </html>\n</div> </div>\n\n==Description of input fields==\n* '''Name:''' Appears in the list of “Automatic exports”.\n* '''Technical description:''' Explains any control parameters and the content that is fetched.\n* '''Parameters 1 – n:''' Up to 20 parameters can be submitted, which are then replaced in the SQL. This allows the calling tool to set the scope of the query dynamically. For example, you can submit an offset, a limit or a specific status that the SQL should search for. The design possibilities here are virtually unlimited.\n* '''Test variables:''' used to test the export during setup. Enter the parameters however you want them to be replaced in the subsequent test run. (e.g. Offset=5, Limit=5)\n* '''SQL statement:''' This part requires in-depth knowledge of the underlying data structure. The specified parameters are shown here as placeholders (e.g. SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... Limit [Limit] Offset [Offset])\n* '''XSLT file:''' The result returned as the output of the SQL query has a specific XML structure. The XSLT then serves to reformat the standard XML output according to your own preferences, insert any additional tags that are needed, or to generate sums and the like and include them in the delivered XML. \n:The XSLT can also transform the exported data into a '''CSV (text file)''' output format. In this case, the “XMLExport” variable must be '''replaced''' by “CSVExport” in the request URL.\n* '''Authentication key:''' each export is subject to authentication.

You can thus immediately see whether settings have been adopted and can jump directly to them.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note the following information:\n\n* Access rights and settings (e.g. application forms, data protection regulations, branch-specific e-mails, automation rules) are \"inherited\" from the superordinate branch, provided that these settings are not contradictory to those of the subordinate branch.\n* A maximum of five hierarchy levels can be mapped, which you can also view via a visualization aid.\n* The filter/search function only \"accesses\" the selected branch(es). I.e. the subordinate branch/s should be explicitly selected (in the filter settings) and searched. If only the parent branch is selected, search results from child branches will not be displayed.\n\n* '''Description'''\n:* Branch office description\n:* Home page<br>Enter the URL that should be used for the “More information about the company” link in job postings.\n:* Text block 1<br>Introductory sentence or phrase that appears before the position title.

New branch offices are usually created by the administrator.\n\nSettings that are configured for a branch office: \n* Creating a new branch office and assigning a '''Name'''\n* Defining the '''[[Profile of branch office|branch office profile]]''', e.g. ''Basic information'' and ''Address''\n* Setting up '''[[Users overview (Applicant Management)|users]]''' and corresponding '''permissions'''\n* Defining a branch office-specific '''[[Data protection policy & data release|privacy policy statement]]'''\n* Setting up the '''default texts for job postings''' and the corresponding '''[[Advertisement layouts|default job posting layouts]]''' ''1'',''2''\n* Setting up '''[[Job subscription & Set up unsolicited application|job alert subscriptions & unsolicited applications]]''' ''1'',''2''\n* Setting up branch office-specific '''[[System e-mails|system emails]]''', e.g. the ''welcome email'' or ''activation emails for job alert subscriptions'' ''1'',''2''\n* Defining '''[[Application forms#Branch-specific application forms|branch office-specific application forms]]''' (see notes on [[Branch offices#Application process and Application process configuration|Application process and Application process configuration]])\n\n==Automatic emails==\nYou can set up [[Branch offices|branch office-specific]] welcome emails in Haufe. Be sure to take note of the system’s [[Job subscription & Set up unsolicited application#Email language behavior when applicant has not selected a correspondence language|email-language behavior]] for applicants who have not selected a correspondence language. \n* Welcome emails are sent automatically for online applications and not for manually created or [[imports|imported]] applications.\n\n* The welcome email for an application is always sent in the language of the corresponding [[Vacancy notice (applicant management)|job board]], and is independent of the correspondence of user language that the user has selected. This allows links back to the job board to be included in this email. If no template is available in that language, then the system's default language will be used instead; applicants will receive an email no matter what.\n \n* These emails only need to be filled out for the [[Branch offices|head office]] (assuming that they should have the exact same content everywhere): If a subordinate branch office has no email text of its own, then the system will use the email texts from the [[Branch offices|head office]] by default. If the head office has a version of the email in the selected correspondence language, then that version will be used; if not, the default language is used. \n\nWelcome emails are declared as job board-specific (not language-specific) emails. Which email is sent out depends on the last ID in the URL during the application process — see also: [[Positions published externally|Jobs published externally]] and [[Multilingual job market|multilingual job board]].<br><br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Be careful when using HTML job posting layouts:''' Errors can sometimes occur with the job board ID, which is responsible for selecting the correct welcome email.   \n\n===Example: Welcome email for applications===\n\n[[File:Willkommens_E_Mail.png|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 1: Example of a welcome email]]\n\n<br><br><br><br><br><br>\nAs mentioned in the guidelines on the [[Integrating applicant management|Applicant Management integration]] page, it is not recommended that you use the two parameter variants: ''/Jobs/All'' and ''/Jobs/2'' for customizing welcome emails. This email cannot identify where the applicant enters the site.\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n\n===Automatic status emails to applicants at this branch office===\nHere, you can set up how emails are automatically sent to applicants depending on their status. \n\n'''Example:''' You set up an automatic email for the “ ''Decline'' ” application status, to be sent out two days after that status is set. You also specify the new application status that should be assigned to the application, presumably: ''Declined''. In this case, all applicants to this branch office whose application status has been set to ''Decline'' will receive an automatic email two days (and +/- 2 hours) later, e.g. to decline their application after an interview. The status of their application will then also automatically change to ''Declined''. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Important notes:''' \n* Automatic emails are sent x days later (depending on the value entered for “ ''Send after change in application status [days]''”), and at the same time of day ('''+/- 2 hours''') as when the status was changed. It is recommended that you make such changes at “peak hours” in order to avoid having emails sent out to applicants at unusual/non-working hours.\n* Automatic emails are only sent on work days, Monday through Friday. If the planned send date would fall on a weekend, then the mail will be sent on the next work day. Holidays are not skipped. \n* If an automatic email could not be sent correctly, you will be informed with a warning message. You also have the option to display a search link on the home page that will take you to a list of all applications for which [[#Bewerbungen mit fehlgeschlagenen automatischen E-Mails|automatic emails have failed]]. \n* If you have set up an automatic email for a status, and then assign that status to an application, the email will be sent at the specified time (as explained above). However, if you '''change''' the '''status''' again in this case, then the automatic email that was originally “ready” to be sent for this status will be '''canceled'''. This prevents automatic emails from being sent even after a correction has been made to the application status. Of course, “canceling” the sending of an automatic email in this way, by changing or correcting the status, is only possible '''before''' the time specified in “''Send after change in application status [days]''” has expired. <br>[[File:info.gif]] ''In such cases, you should also check whether the “new” (corrected) status is set up to trigger an automatic email of its own.'' \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note when creating automatic emails that an application’s status is automatically set to \"Application submitted\", for example, when the application is first received. Therefore, be sure to set up the \"Automatic emails\" functionality in such a way that the automatic process you create does not end up sending out any undesired emails. \n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> '''Add new automatic status email''' (Click on \"Expand\") <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The default recipient of the status-dependent email is the applicant. For applications submitted through a recruiter, the email goes to the recruiter. The default sender is the person who set the most recent status. If this person has no email address, or if, for example, the status was imported, then the responsible HR expert is used as the sender. <br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that if you set the same status, an email loop will be triggered that will continuously send out emails. The “old” and new status should therefore never be the same when using automatic status emails.\n\n* '''Label*''':\n: Required field. Please select a meaningful label.\n* '''Fallback email template''':\n: Optional. Please select an email template. If you would like to insert a personal message into the automatic status email, you can do so by using a variable – for example, the variable for the comment on the newly set status, [Bewerbung.StatusBemerkung], which must be placed at an appropriate location in the email template. It is also possible to insert pre-defined text blocks into an email, e.g. depending on the application status, by using [IF Bewerbung.StatusCode = ‘xyz’] Your Text Here [END]. <br> This template is used as a fallback if there is no language-specific template. \n\nNext, select the language-specific email template. Depending on how many languages are activated within your solution, dropdown fields will be shown for each language, which you can use to select the corresponding email template. The following are examples for German and English: \n* '''Email-template (''German'')''':\n: Please select the email template for German as user language. This language-specific template will be prioritized over the non-language-specific template.\n* '''Email-template (''English'')''':\n: Please select the email template for English as user language. This language-specific template will be prioritized over the non-language-specific template.\n----\n* '''Send after change in application status [days]*''':\t\n: Required field. Enter a 2 here if you want to send out the email 48 hours after the application status is set. Automatic status emails are only sent on work days, Monday through Friday. If the automatic email would be sent on a weekend, it is instead sent on the next work day. Holidays are not skipped. Please enter only integer values. \n: [[File:attention.gif]] If a zero (0) is entered here, the email will be sent out immediately after the status change (or after no more than three hours) — and on weekends too, in this case. \n* '''For application status*''':\t\n: Required field. Define an appropriate application status that should trigger the sending of the automatic email. \n* '''For user language'''\n: Optional. If you do not select a user language, then all applicants for this branch office with the specified status will receive this email. \n* '''New application status*:'''\n: Required field. Indicates the status that the application should change to. If you enter the same status that was already used in the search filter \"For application status\", then this will create a loop in which an email will be sent out every few days (as specified above in \"Send after change in application status\"). \n</div></div>\n\n====Applications with failed automatic emails====\nYou can choose to display a search link on the home page that will take you to a pre-filtered overview that shows all the failed automatic emails. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] They are marked with a warning triangle (if [[Configuration mode|displayed]]).\n\n==Other automatic actions==\nYou can use this tab to set up [[#Automatischer Status|automatic status changes]] (and [[#Automatische Archivieren, Anonymisieren oder Löschen von Bewerbungen|automatic archiving, anonymization or deletion of applications]]). \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important notes:''' \n* Always proceed cautiously when configuring automatic actions. Think carefully about the settings you configure, and inform any affected co-workers of automatic actions to avoid misunderstandings. Please be sure to take your country’s specific legal requirements into account as well. \n* If the setting \"Also apply to affiliate branch offices\" is set in the main branch, the automatisms for archiving, anonymizing or deleting applications also apply to all other branch offices.\n\n===Automatic status===\nHere you can set up the system to automatically decline certain applications or automatically forward them to managers when certain specific conditions are met. For example, you can choose to only forward applications with high point scores, or automatically decline applications with low point scores via automatic status emails by setting up automatic rules for “Decline” status here. Setting additional conditions can help you to further automate and speed up your work when there are lots of incoming applications. All conditions apply simultaneously. If two or more competing conditions apply to a given application, the condition that is listed first takes priority. Only active (= non-archived) applications are affected. The conditions are applied every 6 hours. [[File:attention.gif]] To avoid infinite loops, please ensure that the target status is never the same as the trigger status.\n\n====Condition — useful e.g. for declining applications====\n* '''If % points are less than:''' ''(value)''\n: Specify the percentage. All applications that score lower than this percentage on the [[Selection criteria|selection criteria]] will be included under this condition. \n* '''If application is in application status:''' ''(application status)''\n: Specify the application status(es).

Subsequently, the settings of the parent branch(es) will be linked to (see also: [[#Connect with settings of parent branch office|Connect with settings of parent branch office]]).\n\n:* '''Activate a specific configuration of the application form'''\n::You can configure the application form for each branch office. Please bear in mind that in general, all fields that are used by at least one branch office must be displayed. Please set up the configuration first, before activating this option. Otherwise, any applications submitted in the meantime will be incomplete.<br>\n::[[File:info.gif]] Note also that when using branch office-specific application forms, the jobs in question must also contain assigned branch offices. To prevent erroneous behavior, you should therefore '''not''' remove branch office assignments from these jobs.\n\n:* '''Application without login'''\n::If you activate the option \"Application without login\", applicants will not be asked to enter an email address and password. The corresponding fields will automatically be hidden when this option is activated. Please note that in this case, applicants will also be unable to log in to upload additional documents for their applications, for example. However, this access can be provided later in the process. Please also note that multiple applications from the same person will lose their connection, and will be displayed in the application documents under \"Other applications with same email address or same name\". Activating the ''Application without login'' function also precludes the use of the [[Job subscribers|job alert subscription]] function.\n:::[[File:attention.gif]] Please configure the [[Welcome and job subscription email|Welcome email]] accordingly when activating the \"Application without login\" option.  \n\n----\n:* '''Activate structured reason for application status'''\n: [[File:attention.gif]] When the option '''Structured reason for application status''' is activated, '''all sub-status will be treated as reasons'''. \n:: With this option activated, hierarchically subordinate application statuses are stored in a separate field as structured and analyzable reasons (disposition codes). The corresponding parent application status is stored as the actual application status in the status field. Therefore, you have the option e.g. to combine the Decline status with the reason for declining, without having to have too many different main statuses in the system. Please adapt your list of application status [[Selection lists|selection lists]] for this purpose. Be sure to also make use of the available options when applicants withdraw their applications independently, since statuses subordinate to the ‘Application withdrawn’ status (ID 2190) can now be retrieved directly as a structured reason when withdrawing the application. Therefore, choose an appropriate wording for these subordinate statuses.\n\n:: '''Example:''' You are already using a ''Declined''. Now enter an additional selection list value (e.g. ''Lacks required skills'') and set the existing value “Declined” as the “parent category”. You have now set up parent category and a subcategory, or (in this case) a parent status and a sub-status. In this situation, the sub-status will automatically be treated as the reason for the main status.\n:: Result for this example: Application status including reason: \n:::* Application status: '''Declined'''\n:::* Reason: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'''> Lacks required skills''' \n::: Other example selection values for '''Reason for declining''' in an application might include: ''Lacks required skills; Not considered; Qualifications do not meet minimum requirements; Better-qualified candidate selected; Salary expectations too high; No residence permit; Job will not be filled/Job was withdrawn; Lack of education/experience/certification; Not willing to travel,'' etc.\n::: Selection values can also be made available for applicants who decide to '''withdraw their application'''. For example, you could create the following selection list values to provide applicants with “Reasons for withdrawal” of their application: ''No longer interested; Could not contact; Insufficient salary; Challenges not interesting; No interview possible; Found a better job; Expectations for salary/work hours/vacation not met; Not willing to travel; Unable to relocate,'' etc.\n\n:: '''Associated [[Variables|export variables]]:'''\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The application statuses that are then available for selection will depend on which branch office a given application belongs to. If the status list cannot be uniquely assigned to an application, then all activated application statuses for all of the user’s branch offices will be accumulated together. Please be sure not to create the same status multiple times, since this reduces readability and analyzability.

The help content for Pentaho’s main functionalities was created from the original Pentaho Business Analytics documentation. You can open the documentation in your business analytics solution via Help > Documentation... The following link will bring you to the publicly accessible documentation site for Pentaho: https://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/6.1/\n\n=umantis Business Analytics=\n\nThe umantis Business Analytics solution offers a variety of ways to analyze, visualize and generate data. With just a few clicks, you can use the displayed data to investigate specific details and trends to help you in your decision-making process. You can either generate your own reports or use pre-defined Best Practice Reports. You can find sample reports in the [[#BA Best Practice Reports|Best Practice Reports/Samples]]. If you would like to integrate Pentaho into your umantis solution, please get in touch with your umantis contact. \n\n==Working with Pentaho==\n\nIf Pentaho business analytics is already integrated in your umantis solution, you will find it on the following tab:\n\n*  In umantis [[Applicant management|Applicant management ]]under: <em>Evaluation &gt; Business Analytics</em> (https://recruitingapp-XXX.umantis.com'''/BusinessIntelligence''')\n*  In umantis [[Employee management|Employee management ]]under: '''&lt;tbd&gt;'''\n\n==Getting Started==\n\nAfter registration, Business Analytics provides three tabs to get you started:\n\n*  '''Welcome'''\n\n: From this tab, you can launch an introductory video that will give you an initial overview of the core functions in Business Analytics. \n\n*  '''Samples'''\n\n: In the '''Samples''' tab, you will find examples of commonly used reports.\n\n*  '''Tutorials'''\n\n: This tab contains tutorials to help make working with Pentaho easier.\n\n=BA User Console=\n'''The BA User Console''' is the main area for users to create or modify reports.<br>\nIn this area, the user can navigate through the sub-areas described below and perform various actions. <br>\n[[File:BAUserconsole en.PNG|500px]]<br>\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note that you should save new reports only in your own files folder: <br>\nLocation: ''Your solution number/home/your folder''\n\n[[File:BA_Speicherort.png|400px]]\n\nIf you do not have permission to save a file in a certain folder, you will receive an error message: <br>\n''The file cannot be saved.

Choose from '''Show Gap, Connect with Dotted Line''', or '''Treat as Zero'''.\n|}\n\n==BA Visualizations for Analyzer/Chart Types==\nAfter you have created an analytics report, you will most likely want to make the report more visually pleasing and meaningful for your audience. Analyzer has several built-in visualizations that make it easy to present your data in a way that people can intuitively understand. We also give you many different ways to customize your visualizations.<br>\nBoth the '''Layout''' and '''Property''' panels in the Analyzer workspace change dynamically based on the visualization that is currently selected. The Layout panel shows you what data is needed for the current visualization, and the '''Property''' panel lets you add or change options such as data labels, color patterns, or bullet styles.<br>\nThe optional properties for each visualization type are listed in each section. You can use any or all of these properties for each visualization to make your report more intuitive for your audience. The Chart Options dialog gives you more ways to customize reports.\n\n===Column and Bar Charts===\nColumn and bar charts are among the most recognizable visualizations for data. Column charts display their data vertically, while bar charts display the same data horizontally.\n\n[[File:Column and bar charts EN.png|400px]]\n\nColumn and bar charts are good for just about every kind of data; however, they tend to work best when you do not have a large number of variables to display. Drilling down into your data is easy: just double-click on a column or bar in the report.\n\n[[File:Column and bar charts EN.png|400px]]\n\n'''Optional properties for Column and Bar charts'''\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Property\n!Description\n!Available In\n|-\n|\nData Labels\n|Use this to label the data features of your report to reflect what they represent. You can also choose no Data Labels, or specify where you want them to appear.\n|all Column and Bar charts\n|-\n|\nColumn or Line Data Labels \n|Use this to put data labels on your columns or lines, or both.\n|Column/Line Combo charts\n|-\n|\nTrend Type\n|Shows a trend type of none or linear. If you choose linear, you can name your trend line and set its width.\n|Column charts\n|}\n\n===Line and Area Charts===\nLine and area chart visualizations show data on a graph by connecting plotted points with a line. Each point represents a single value in your data. You can drill down in both chart types by double-clicking on a data point.<br>\nA line chart shows just the line connecting the dots on the graph, and works well if you have a large amount of data to analyze.\n\n\n[[File:Line and Area Chart EN.png|400px]]\n\nAn area chart shows an aggregate of your data and helps you spot trends quickly, by showing totals and how they are moving relative to each other.\n\n[[File:Line and Area Chart2 EN.png|400px]]\n\nBoth types of chart are good if you want to identify trends that happen over a period of time, such as for financial growth, real estate sales, or test scores.\n\n'''Optional properties for Line and Area charts'''\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Property\n!Description\n!Available In\n|-\n|\nData Labels\n|Data Labels\tUse this to label the data features of your report to reflect what they represent. You can also choose no Data Labels, or specify where you want them to appear.\n|Line and area Charts\n|-\n|\nBullet Style\n|Choose the shape that you want to use for your bullets.\n|Line charts\n|-\n|\nLine Width\n|Specify the width of lines in your report.\n|Line Charts\n|-\n|\nTrend Type\n|Shows a trend type of ''none'' or ''linear''. If you choose ''linear'', you can name your trend line and set its width.\n|Line charts\n|}\n\n===Pie and Sunburst Charts===\nPie charts are representations of your data as a circle cut into slices. Each slice represents a piece of data, and the size of the slice is proportional to the data that it represents. Double-clicking on a slice lets you drill down into your data.<br>\nPie charts are a great way to show numerical or financial data— in other words, the value of one element relative to the whole group.\n\n[[File:Pie and Sunburst Charts EN.png|400px]]\n\nSunburst visualizations organize and display your data in a series of colored rings. Starting with the center ring, each ring going outward represents more detailed information relating to the inner ring to which it is connected. These outer rings are arranged and colored to indicate their hierarchical relationship with the inner ring. Any fields that contain empty slices can be shown as gaps in the sunburst.<br>\nYou can drill down into your data by double-clicking on a data slice. The sunburst then rearranges itself to show the more detailed information.<br>\nSunburst visualizations are particularly well-suited for numerical analysis of hierarchical data.\n\n[[File:Pie and Sunburst Charts2 EN.png|400px]]\n\n'''Optional properties for Pie and Sunburst charts'''\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Property\n!Description\n!Available In\n|-\n|\nData Labels\n|Use this to label the data features of your report to reflect what they represent. You can also choose no Data Labels, or specify where you want them to appear.\n|Pie and sunburst charts\n|-\n|\nOrder By\n|Lets you specify how to sort your data in the report.\n|Sunburst charts\n|-\n|\nEmpty Slices\n|Check this box to show Empty Slices as gaps in the report.\n|Sunburst charts\n|}\n\n===Scatter Chart Visualization===\nScatter charts are related to line and area charts, but show the intersection of x and y values at each data point. These values appear on the scatter chart as a series of bubbles on a graph, based on the attributes you used when you built your report.  You can then use a measure to color-code the bubble, or use a measure to specify the size of the bubble. Drill down by double-clicking on any data point on the chart.<br>\nScatter charts work well to show the categorical relationship between two sets of numerical measures, e.g. between a budgeted amount and the actual amount of money spent.\n\n[[File:Scatter Chart EN.png|400px]]\n\n'''Optional properties for Scatter Chart visualization '''\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Property\n!Description\n!Available In\n|-\n|\nData Labels\n|Use this to label the data features of your report to reflect what they represent. You can also choose no Data Labels, or specify where you want them to appear.\n|Scatter Chart visualization\n|-\n|\nTrend Type\n|Shows a trend type of ''none'' or ''linear''. If you choose ''linear'', you can name your trend line and set its width.\n|Scatter Chart visualization\n|}\n\n===Heat Grid Visualization===\nHeat Grids let you visualize data to identify patterns of performance. This visualization type will color-code your results so you can view complex business analytics in an easy-to-understand way. Drill down into your data by double-clicking any square on the grid. Heat Grids are especially well-suited for comparing categorical data using color.\n\n[[File:Heat Grid EN.png|400px]]\n\n'''Optional properties for Heat Grid visualization''' \n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Property\n!Description\n!Available In\n|-\n|\nData Labels\n|Use this to label the data features of your report to reflect what they represent. You can also choose no Data Labels, or specify where you want them to appear.\n|Heat Grid visualization\n|-\n|\nPattern\n|Choose from Gradient, 3 Step, or 5 Step patterns.\n|Heat Grid visualization\n|-\n|\nColor\n|Choose from different combinations of colors for your report.\n|Heat Grid visualization\n|-\n|\nReverse Colors\n|Reverses the order of colors in the report.\n|Heat Grid visualization\n|-\n|\nBullet Style\n|Choose the shape that you want to use for your bullets.\n|Heat Grid visualization\n|}\n\n=BA Report Filters=\n'''Filters''' are used to restrict or limit data in a report, building the report to show only the information that you want to view.<br>\nFor example, a typical report shows job applications by branch office. A time filter on Quarter restricts the data so that only job applications for the selected quarter are shown.<br>\nIf you add a location filter for country, the report would display data pertaining to country-specific job applications for that quarter. If you add a filter on another field to exclude a job application, the report would display data pertaining to country-specific job applications in that quarter which are also not a part of the excluded area.\n\n'''BA Analytics supports two type of filters:'''\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n|\nNormal filters\n|Filters are used to restrict or limit data in a report, building the report to show only the information that you want to view.\n|-\n|\nDate range filters\n|Date range filters allow you to show only data that meets the conditions of the filter in a report. For example, you can create filters to display data between 2010 and 2013, or all data after 2010. After you have applied your filter, the Analyzer report shows only data specified by the date ranges that you selected.\n|}\n\n===Create Normal Filters===\nFollow these steps to add a filter to your Analyzer report.<br>\n\n1. Login to the User Console, and click '''Browse Files''' to browse to the location of your Analyzer report.<br>\n2. Open the report. Click the blue plus sign next to '''No Filters''' on the toolbar near the top of the report. A workspace for filters appears at the top of the report.\n\n[[File:Normalfilter en.PNG|400px]]\n\n3. From the Data Source pane, click and drag a field or column into the filter workspace. The Filter dialog box appears. Notice that the values associated with the field are listed in the dialog box. You can choose one of these values, or you can enable '''Match a specific string''' to filter the report on a specific string of data.<br>\n4. Select the value or values that you want from the '''Add Selected''' list and click the arrow to move it into the right pane. The value appears with a green check mark next to it in the right pane.<br>\n5. After you have selected all values that you need from the list, click '''OK''' to exit the dialog box. Your Analyzer report displays data for the chosen values only.<br>\n6. Save your report.\n\nThe Analyzer report is filtered and saved. You can click '''Undo''' or '''Reset''' to return to the previous version of the report.\n\n===Create Date Range Filters===\nDate range filters enable you to show only data that meets the conditions of the filter in a report. For example, you can create filters to display data between 2010 and 2013, or all data after 2010. After you have applied your filter, the Analyzer report shows only data specified by the date ranges that you selected.<br>\n\n1. Log in to the User Console, then open an existing analytics report that contains a time dimension, or choose '''Create New > New Analysis'''.<br>\n2. For a new report, select the data source that you want to use and click '''OK'''.<br>\n3. Create the report with a time dimension, such as year or quarter.<br>\n4. Click the icon to Add a Filter, then drag the time dimension that you want to filter on to the '''Filters''' board. You can also right-click on the dimension and add it as a filter.<br>\n5. Choose one of the available radio buttons to create your filter:<br>\n* Use '''Choose a commonly used time period''' to specify a time period such as '''Current Quarter, Same Quarter last year''', or '''Calendar Month'''. Once you have your time period specified, click '''OK''' to apply the filter. These filters are dynamic and change with the current date. The other date filters are static.\n\n[[File:Daterangefilter1 en.PNG|400px]]\n\n* '''Select from a list''' lets you choose values from a list. You can use the single right or left arrows to add or remove one value at a time, or use the double right or left arrows to add or remove all values in the list. Click '''OK''' to apply the filter to your report.\n* By choosing '''Select a range''', then clicking the '''Select from date picker''' link, you can use the date picker calendars to select beginning and ending dates for your report data. Click '''Apply''', then '''OK''', to apply the filter to your report.\n\n[[File:Daterangefilter2 en.PNG|400px]]\n\n* Once you select a date, the data is validated to make sure that your date ranges actually contain that date. Analyzer searches for the nearest time period, up to plus or minus 30 time periods, if no date is found on the first attempt. You will not be able to save the date filter if no dates are found.\n\n[[File:Daterangefilter3 en.PNG|400px]]\n\nWhen you create a date range filter using the '''Between (and incl.)''' operator and parameterize it, as described in Add Query Parameters in Analyzer Reports, you specify one parameter name, but two parameters are created. One parameter controls the start of the range, and another controls the end of the range. The start date parameter is <YourParameterName>_START, and the end date parameter is <YourParameterName>_END.<br>\nThe '''Choose a commonly used time period''' option and the '''Between, After''' and '''Before''' filters are available only if time dimension levels are set up with the AnalyzerDateFormat annotation.\n\n=BA Schema Editor=\n'''BA Schema Editor''' is used for managing schemas (dimensions & measures) in different cubes.<br>\nUsing the editor, users can perform two main functions:<br>\n1) Modify measure and dimension names (caption) and descriptions (mouseover help text) in supported languages (currently English and German only).<br>\n2) Hide or unhide the dimensions and measures of a cube.\n\n[[File:Schemaeditor en.PNG|400px]]\n\n==User actions==\n'''Modifying a caption or description is very simple:'''<br>\n1. Identify/Select the cube, e.g. Application, Jobs, Applicant.<br>\n2. Select by clicking on any dimension/measure name from the dropdown menu at the left.<br>\n3. Select the language from the dropdown menu.<br>\n4. Modify the caption and/or description as desired.<br>\n\n'''Hiding the dimension/measure:'''<br>\nSelect the value on the left side; then, on the right, just uncheck the '''Visible''' checkbox as desired.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Note:<br>\na.) Changing the group name change will affect all dimensions linked under the same group.<br>\nb.) The user must click the Modify button in order to save their changes; changes are not saved automatically.<br>\nc.) Changes will be saved only for the selected user language.\n\n=BA Cubes=\nCubes are divided into three core areas / entities in the Recruitingapp solution, namely Applications, Applicants and Jobs.\n\nIn addition there is a LifeCycle Transition cube that hold ''active'' recruiting data for complex analysis. ''Active'' data means that it holds data for all jobs and applications that experienced a  status change within the last 365 days.\n\n[[File:Cubes en.png|400px]]\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\"

Applications in relation to the Job-related fields from Recruitingapp, e.g. Application Source, Application Status etc.\n|-\n|\nJobs\n|This cube shows the dimensions, member properties and measures solely from the perspective of the Job-related fields from Recruitingapp, e.g. Job Title.\n|-\n|\nLifecycle Transition \n|This cube shows the additional dimensions for ‘active’ Job & Application Status each aligned with the Status date in combination with above three Cube attributes e.g. Start Job Status, End Job Status, Start Application Status, End Application Status etc. This Cube is aligned with the Status date of Job/Application (Calendar) and not with Creation date (Calendar). \nBA user can easily combine start and end status with dates to find out the duration between two statuses as needed.\n|}\n\nFor more details on field mappings, see [[#BA Dimensions|BA Dimensions]].\n\n===Jobs Cube===\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!AM Job Fields

When updating the details of a measure or adding a calculated measure, you are making changes to the data model from within Analyzer. When you save these changes, they are now a part of the data source for other users to access. We call these types of changes to the data source inline modeling, since these changes are reflected immediately in the data source you are working with. This approach allows you to make model changes easily in Analyzer to benefit other users immediately.\n\n'''Adding a Calculated Measure to the Data Source'''<br>\nCalculated measures are user-defined measures based on a user's customizations to base measures in the data model. By applying a formula, in this case an MDX statement, to a selected base measure, the user creates a calculated measure to use in their Analyzer report.<br>\nSince Pentaho 6.0, you can save your calculated measure to the data model while creating or editing your report in Analyzer. Previously, if you wanted to add a calculated measure to the model for others to use in their reports, you had to submit a request to IT and wait until it was available. Now you can save the calculated measure to the model from within Analyzer, so you can use that new measure without reloading your report. In addition, after you save your report, other users can immediately benefit from your calculated measure.<br>\n\nWhen you create a calculated measure using a measure in the '''Available Fields''' list in Analyzer, it is added to the data source when you save your report. To create a calculated measure within Analyzer, create or open an existing report in Analyzer.<br>\n\n1. In the '''Available Fields''' list, click a measure to select it and then click the down arrow next to it.     \n        \n[[File:Calculatedmeasure en.PNG|400px]]\n                                                                                \n2. From the shortcut menu which appears, select '''Create Calculated Measure'''. The New Calculated Measure dialog box appears. \n\n[[File:Calculatedmeasuredetail en.PNG|400px]]\n\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Field\n!Description\n|-\n|\nName\n|The name of the measure as it displays in the model.\n|-\n|\nFormat\n|Choose how this measure should be formatted, such as currency, general number, or percentage. Use the drop-down arrow to select a format from a system-defined list, or select the “Text” icon next to the field to enter a custom format. If you do not specify a format, the default value of the first base measure is used as the format.\n|-\n|\nDecimal\n|Optionally specify the number of decimal places for the results.\n|-\n|\nFormula\n|In the right panel, enter the formula for your calculated measure. You can type the MDX statement manually, or you can use the list on the left to drag measures into the right panel. You can also use the symbol buttons below to help create your statement, or just use your keyboard to type in the expression.\n|-\n|\nCreate subtotals using measure\n|Select this check box to use this calculated measure when adding up subtotals in your report.\n|}\n\n\n3. In the '''Name''' field, enter a name for your calculated measure.<br>\n4. In the '''Format''' field, specify how you want the results of your measure to appear in your report. You can optionally specify the number of decimal places for the results. If you do not specify a format, the default value of the first base measure is used as the format.<br>\n5. In the right panel, enter the formula for your calculated measure. You can type the MDX statement manually, or you can use the list on the left to drag measures into the right panel. You can also use the symbol buttons below to help create your statement, or just use your keyboard to type in the expression.<br>\n6. Select the '''Calculate subtotals using measure formula''' check box to use this calculated measure when adding up subtotals in your report.<br>\n7. Click '''OK''' to save this calculated measure. When you save your report, your calculated measure will also be saved to the data model. Once you save the report, the measure will be available for future reports which use this data source. Or you can click '''Cancel''' to close the dialog box without saving your changes.\n\n===BA Conditional Formatting===\nConditional formatting in the Analyzer data grid means that cells’ appearance will be affected by the data they contain. The most common form of conditional formatting is stoplight reporting, where cell backgrounds are colored red, green, or yellow depending on user-defined thresholds. Analyzer offers some simple pre-defined methods of conditionally formatting numeric data. Follow the directions below to implement conditional cell formatting.\n\n1. Right-click a measure in the grid, then select Conditional Formatting from the context menu. A sub-menu with conditional formatting types will appear.<br>\n2. Select your preferred number format from the list.<br>\nThe analyzer report will refresh and apply the formatting choice you specified. \n\n[[File:Conditionalformatting en.PNG|400px]]\n\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Indicator Type\n!Description\n|-\n|\nColor scale \n|The background cell color will be shaded according to the value of the cell relative to the highest and lowest recorded values in that measure. There are several color progressions to choose from.\n|-\n|\nData bar\n|The cell background is partially filled with a solid color proportional to the scale of the cell's value relative to the highest and lowest recorded values in that measure.\n|-\n|\nTrend arrow \n|An upward or downward arrow is displayed to the right of the cell value depending on whether it contains a positive or negative value.\n|}\n\n==BA Member Properties==\nThe ''member properties'' concept is used in BA for reporting purposes, e.g. to display free-text data specific to applications or jobs.<br>\nAll of the most commonly used free-text fields in the umantis application have been made available as member properties, and can be used in reports as desired. Examples include '''Job created by, Requester''' etc.\n\n'''Identify and Display Member Properties'''\nWhen a number in parentheses appears next to a dimension in a list of available fields, that dimension is associated with specific member properties. You can use those properties to constrain dimensions.\n\n[[File:Memberpropertiesdetail en.PNG|400px]]\n\n1. To review available fields, click '''Add more fields to the report''' on the report toolbar.<br>\n2. Locate a dimension in the '''Available fields''' list that includes a number in parentheses, e.g. Job ID (13), Application ID (8).<br>\n3. Locate the corresponding dimension in your report. Right-click the row or column header for that dimension, then click '''Show Properties'''. A menu displays the member properties you can choose from.<br>\n4. Select or clear the member property you want to display in or remove from the report, then click '''OK'''.\n\n[[File:Memberproperties en.PNG|400px]]\n\n5. Your analyzer report is filtered by your choice of member properties.<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] One limitation of member properties is that they cannot be filtered like dimensions can be when used in reports. \nFor a complete list of member properties, see the BA Dimension page.\n\n=BA Business Rules=\nThe following business rules provide users with a basic overview of access rights and visibility of data in the BA area.\n\n\n\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n|\n'''Create and save new analytics report'''\n|1. All users can view the report based on reports embedded in Iframes in the view(s) they have access to (e.g. SelfServiceLine, SelfService Board etc.).<br>2. At present, only system administrators, administrators and HR can create reports (i.e. only these groups have access to the Business Analytics user console).<br>3. Only system administrators and administrators can embed a report in an Iframe (i.e. only these groups are authorized to use CWC mode).\n|-\n|\n'''Business Rule - Data Visibility''' \n|Branch office restrictions affect which data the user can see in reports/charts; if the '''Branch office restrictions''' flag is on for a given user, then that user can access only the data from their own branch office(s). To allow a user to see all data, the '''Branch office restrictions''' flag should be set to off.\n|-\n|\n'''Business Rule - Reports'''\n|A user can create and save reports in their private user folder (folder with username). To share reports publicly, the reports can be moved/copied to the Public folder.<br>\nThe main Public folder is used to share best practices reports with all users (who have access to the BI console).\n|-\n|\n'''Business Rule - Export Report''' \n|Reports can be exported from the BI Editor/reports embedded in Iframes based on access to the user.\n|-\n|\n'''Business Rule - Customized KPI/measures''' \n|Users with access to the BI console can create their own user-defined measures/KPI (calculated measures) by using the MDX.\n|}\n\n==BA Language Support==\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n|\n[[File:Yellow.png|10px]]\n|Languages currently supported in BA user console — main Pentaho shell: German, English, French, Japanese\n|-\n|\n[[File:Green.png|10px]]\n|Languages currently supported for AM content / reports / translations of table data: All languages supported in AM as per the language of the logged-in user. \n|-\n|\n[[File:Red.png|10px]]\n|Languages currently supported for BA dimensions/measures: English (default), German\n|}\n\n[[File:Colors.png|500px]]\n\n=BA Best Practice Reports=\n\nThe following table presents examples of frequently used reports.

For example, why do I see 100 applications in the Application overview when there are 125 in the BA report?\n|In BA, nothing is deleted (no data at all). So, if users delete any jobs or applications in the main application, then the count can differ.\n|-\n|\n2.\n|Why do I see more jobs in the Jobs cube than in the Applications cube, e.g. 230 jobs in the Applications cube and 320 jobs in the Jobs cube?\n|In the Applications cube, only those jobs with a minimum of 1 application is shown, whereas in the Jobs cube, all jobs are shown regardless of the number of applications.\n|-\n|\n3.\n|Which cube I should use to create the report?\n|Choose the appropriate cube for the entity, i.e. Jobs, Applications or Applicants.<br> [[#BA Cubes|BA Cubes]]<br> BA Dimensions\n|-\n|\n4.\n|What is the difference between Reporting and Analyzer reports?\n|The major difference is that reporting is more concerned with the current content/data for the entity, whereas the Analyzer is used to show statistics over a period of time.\n|-\n|\n5.\n|How can I embed a report in a screen (Iframe)?\n|See the instructions at the following link: [[#BA User Console|BA User Console]]\n|-\n|\n6.\n|How can I use a new field from the umantis application in the report for reporting/analytics?\n|Please check out the Schema repository and enable the field (dimension): [[#BA Schema Editor|BA Schema Editor]]\n|-\n|\n7.\n|How can I rename or hide dimensions in a cube that my company is not using?\n|See instructions here: [[#BA Schema Editor|BA Schema Editor]]\n|-\n|\n8.\n|Individual sorting of the selection lists from AM is not included in Business Analytics.\n|The sequence of the displayed values in AM may be set for a single supported language. A global series is desirable for numerous analyses to present the sequence of events (e.g.: depiction of the logical time sequence for the relevant status in the recruiting process). This feature is in progress and will be available in a later release.<br> Workaround: In Business Analytics, a click on the column head can arrange everything in alphabetical order or reverse alphabetical order.\n|-\n|\n9.\n|Values are displayed for dimensions which have long since been deleted.\n|The dimensions may display the Status value = “imported” for the job status. From the perspective of Business Analytics, this is correct, as the status did exist at an earlier time.<br> The dimensions may display the Status value = “imported” for the job status. From the perspective of Business Analytics, this is correct, as the status did exist at an earlier time.\n|}\n\n=BA Glossary=\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n!Item\n!Description\n|-\n|\nPentaho\n|Third party BI tool integrated in the umantis suite. The Pentaho BA Server is a Web-based framework that leverages elements of Pentaho Analysis and Pentaho Reporting to provide easy-to-use tools for creation and sharing of reports and dashboards.\n|-\n|\nBusiness Analytics (BA) User Console\n|The BA User Console is part of the Pentaho tool for creating and modifying reports.\n|-\n|\nSchema\n|A schema is a collection of cubes and virtual cubes. It can also contain shared dimensions (for use by those cubes), named sets, roles, and declarations of user-defined functions.\n|-\n|\nCube\n|A cube is a collection of dimensions and measures, all centered on a fact table. In the context of umantis AM, there are cubes defined for areas i.e. Application, Applicant & Vacancy.\n|-\n|\nDimension\n|Dimensions are linked one-to-one with the Application Management fields. For example, the Branch Office field is linked with the Job Title dimension in BI. Most fields with selection lists are created as dimensions so that users can filter the data effectively.\n|-\n|\nMember Property\n|Member properties are subcategories/attributes of dimensions. With member properties, user cannot filter the data. Free-text fields in the umantis application are mostly created as member properties.\n|-\n|\nMeasures\n|A measure is an aggregated numeric value. It is typically a sum of selected numbers in a column, or a count of the number of items in a list. The datatype of this measure can be String, Numeric, Integer, Boolean, Date, Time or Timestamp. The default datatype of a measure is Integer if the measure's aggregator is Count; otherwise it is Numeric. In the umantis context, Number of Applicants and Number of Jobs are formulated as measures.\n|-\n|\nCharts\n|Visualization/ Graphic converted from the tabular form of a report. Every report can be converted to a chart of the desired type, e.g. pie chart, histogram etc.\n|-\n|\nReports\n|Analyzer Reports is an intuitive analytical visualization tool that filters and drills down into business information contained in Pentaho Analysis data sources. Use Analyzer Reports if you want to compile data quickly in an interactive environment, perform advanced sorting and filtering of your data, and want to see chart visualizations that include conditional stop-lighting.  It is important that these reports consist of a combination of dimension(s) plus measure(s); otherwise, the data shown in report will not be correctly formulated.\n|-\n|\nSlowly Changing Dimension(SCD)\n|•\tType I: Changes in the source system result in a corresponding change in the target dimension. For example, if a Job Title is changed from “Scrum Master” to “Scrum Master Developer\", then it will be updated in BA as well. (We do not retain the old value in such cases, e.g. “Scrum Master”.)<br>\n•\tType II: Changes in the source system result in inserting timestamped versions of dimension rows multiple times in the target dimension. This allows you to quickly find any version of the dimension rows at any given point. For example, if the Job Status has changed from “Approved” to “Filled”, both the Job Status values are retained/stored in the BA area. Note that in order for a dimension to qualify as Type II, a time-stamp is required every time a value is added or changed.\n|-\n|\nAnalysis Report\n|Analyzer has an easy to use, web-based, drag-and-drop design environment that can be used by anyone who wants to dynamically explore data and drill down to discover previously hidden details. You do not need any special expertise to use Analyzer. You can display Analyzer reports in a dashboard in the User Console.\n|-\n|\nData Source\n|Actual source of the data, separated into different cubes with relationships among them. Currently supported data sources (cubes) are Applicants, Application & Jobs.\n|-\n|\nDashboard\n|Pentaho Analyzer offers many ways to visually display data. These graphics are called visualizations, and include maps, charts, and grids. After creating the reports, users have the option to create dashboards that use multiple reports.\n|-\n|\nAuthorization\n|Access privileges defined for the user based on their role and other conditions in the umantis solution. For BI-related authorization, see link.\n|-\n|\nMDX\n|Used to create the calculated measures.\n|}"

However, the core information for the certificate is valid and effective even if you do not use the RTF file. <br>\nAll existing templates are shown under [[Communication|Communication]] > [[Templates|Templates]] (/Communications/Templates). Filter on templates of type “Certificate” to show certificates only.\n\n==Certificate settings==\n\nThe general settings for the certificate are configured under the associated event. The [[Events|Events]] tab includes a global overview of all events. In the overview, select the event for which you want to set up a certificate. You can then set the title, document category and period of validity for the certificate in the “Certificate settings” section of the detailed view of the event.<br> \n*'''Set certificate’s period of validity'''<br>\n** ''Valid from'': Date from which the certificate is valid. This value takes precedence over the dynamically generated validity period (length in days). \n** ''Valid until'': Date until which the certificate is valid. This value takes precedence over the dynamically generated validity period (length in days).  \n\n* '''Period of validity in days (dynamic)''' \n: When setting a certificate’s period of validity, you have the option to enter the period length dynamically: If you manually enter the length of the validity period (in days) for the certificate, the date when its validity expires is calculated automatically. In this case, the certificate becomes valid at the time when it is issued, and remains valid until the specified number of days have passed. This setting is especially useful when copying courses, or for online courses which can be taken at a variety of different times, since the period of validity is automatically copied over and the “Valid until” date does not have to be manually recalculated and re-entered each time.  \n\n----\n'''Visibility'''\n:* Certificate is visible for recipients\n:* Certificate is visible for managers\n\n* '''Certificate document via template assignment'''\n: Here, you have the option to use a particular document when creating certificates.

Use variables to allow participant information, valid dates, or even a certificate header to be populated into the document dynamically. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:'''<br>\n* You also have the option to generate a certificate document. Templates for RTF certificates are managed under '''/Communications/Templates''', like all other templates.\n* When certificates are managed through a dashboard (named “Certificate overview”, ID 25), the certificate’s title must be added as a code to each document category.

This will take you to the detailed view (Details tab) for the selected event. Click on the Participants tab to see the global overview of all participants. The '''Certificates''' section provides an overview of all certificates that have been added for this event. In this section, you can upload existing certificates for the event, create new ones, or edit the ones that are already listed here.<br> \nClick on [[File:Edit.GIF]] and enter all the required information (title, category, etc.). - You can then upload the [[Record certificate template|completed documents / certificates]]. <br> \nOnce you have specified all the necessary information, click Add.

Click on the “Quick view” link to open a PDF preview of the selected certificate. Then check whether there are any formatting errors, and update the certificate if necessary.\n\nIn the Participants tab, select the desired participants and apply the appropriate [[Multiple selections and multiple actions|multiple action]]: \n* ''Change status and issue certificate'' \n* ''Change status and delete certificates''\n\nAfter clicking ‘Apply’, a dialog box appears with the following selection/setup options:\n* ''Change consent status''\n: Select the appropriate consent status from the dropdown menu.\n\nIf a certificate has already been created under “Event settings > Certificate settings”, the following certificate information will be displayed:\n* ''Certificate title:''\n* ''Valid from:''\n* ''Valid until:''\n: ''Period of validity in days (dynamic): \n* ''Document:''\n: If you have added a document template under “Event settings > Certificate settings”, you will also see a link to that document.\n* ''Visible to recipient:''\n: Certificate recipients can see the certificates in their profile.\n* ''Visible to managers:''\t \n: Managers can see the certificates in the manager view.\n* ''Overwrite certificates'':\t\n: Any certificates already created for '''this''' event will be overwritten by the new certificate.\n----\n\n* ''Link to certificate template''\n: You can generate a certificate entry either with or without a document.

As a customer, you have already been informed of this, and referred to the following website which contains all the important details, questions and answers:\nhttps://customer.umantis.com/information/changing-data-center\n\nBelow, you will find the settings/configuration guidelines required for the change. Please note that some of these only apply to specific customer environments and are therefore not relevant for all customers. If certain settings have to be configured (before or after the data center change), you will be explicitly informed in advance.\n\n==Customer-specific URL==\n''If you are using a [[System requirements#Tips on customer-specific URL / custom domain names|customer-specific URL]], certain adjustments must be made before the change. You have been or will be directly contacted and supported by a [mailto:hostingcenter_questions@haufe.com Customer Service] specialist.''\n\n==Mail relay==\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition and continued full functionality of the Haufe solution, customers who are using a [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP-Relay-Server mail relay] must review their mail relay settings. To do this, please take note of the following information: \n\n=====Mail relay — What is it?=====\n* Customer environments with a correctly configured mail relay allow our applications to send customer-specific emails through mail relay servers (belonging to the customers). To prevent misuse, such access is authorized. For these customer environments, authorization is based on the IP addresses of the e-mail senders, i.e. the Haufe mail servers. The authorized addresses are compiled in a \"whitelist\" on the mail relay server. If these entries are not in place, the Haufe emails will be rejected.\n\n=====When do I have to make which settings?=====\n* '''Before''' the data center change, you '''must''' add the '''server names''' of the two mail servers at the new data center (Germany: Frankfurt and Switzerland: Zurich) and the backup data center (Germany: Rüsselsheim and Switzerland: Geeneva) '''to the whitelist for the mail relay server''': \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 60%;\"\n! Germany\n! Switzerland\n|-\n| mail01.de.umantis.com\n| mail01.umantis.com\n|-\n| mail02.de.umantis.com\n| mail02.umantis.com\n|-\n| mail03.de.umantis.com\n| mail03.umantis.com\n|-\n| ''After the successful relocation of your customer solution to the new data center, the previously valid IP addresses (213.95.13.132 and 213.95.13.133) should be removed from the whitelist.''\n| ''After the successful relocation of your customer solution to the new data center, the previously valid IP addresses (31.11.29.203 and 31.11.29.204) should be removed from the whitelist.''\n|}\n\n=====Who can configure these settings?=====\n* These settings are configured by you, the responsible staff members in your IT department, or the staff in charge of the mail server. The responsible person is informed of the customer-specific email domain and the name of the server that is used as the mail relay. We will send you this information (email domain and server name) via email. \n\n=====How can I check whether the settings are correct?=====\n* We (at Haufe) can only check the correctness of the settings after the customer environment has been moved, i.e. only when emails are sent through the mail servers at the new data center. However, if the customer has limited the sending of mail in such a way that Haufe receives no notification, then Haufe must depend on the customer’s reaction.\n\n==SPF entry==\n[[File:attention.gif]] If you have set up an SPF entry, you must check it before the move. The entry should comply with our standard, which is described on the following page: [[SPF entry|SPF entry]]\n\n==IP address==\nNormally, no modifications need to be made unless you have configured specific settings. Because these are local settings that we cannot access, we cannot determine whether you have configured specific settings or not. For this reason, all customers receive an email communication that contains a link to a website. This website can only be opened if '''no''' specific IPs are stored on your system. Customers who cannot open this page should [mailto:hostingcenter_questions@haufe.com contact us] immediately to obtain new IPs for the ''primary'' and ''secondary'' data center.\n\n==Contact==\nWe have set up a central email address to which you can send any questions you may have about the data center change: [mailto:hostingcenter_questions@haufe.com hostingcenter_questions@haufe.com]\n\n==Related topics==\n* [https://customer.umantis.com/information/wechsel-des-datenzentrums Data center change FAQs]\n* [[SPF entry|SPF entry]]"

When forwarding an email, manually enter the email address to which you want to forward the email.<br> \n[[File:Curly_arrow.PNG]]  - This icon appears next to an email in the communication history (in the overview table on the right) to indicate that the mail in question has been resent or forwarded. \nIn the detailed view of an email, you can see that the email was a copy if the section labeled “Email was forwarded or resent based on original email” is visible, with a link to the original email. \n\n[[File:checkmark.gif]] '''Note:''' Please note that you cannot automatically resend or forward '''all [[System e-mails|system emails]]''' (the relevant actions are '''not''' shown), and that emails can '''only be resent or forwarded to [[People directory|external individuals]]''' (e.g. to applicants).\n----\n\n==Create email from template==\n'''Send email from a template to one recipient'''<br>\nTo send someone an [[Send email from template|email from a template]], click on the name of the intended recipient. If you don't see the person's name in this view, you can use the search function to find it. Clicking on their name will automatically take you to their profile. Click on the “Communication” tab. The “Create email from template” link will be visible on the left. Click on the link and select the [[Templates#E-mail templates|email template]] you want to use. Click “Create”. You will now see the email that will be sent out, and can modify it as necessary, e.g. by adding more recipients, changing the message or the subject line, attaching additional files, etc.\n\n'''Send email from a template to multiple recipients'''<br>\nTo send an [[Send email from template|email from a template]] to multiple recipients, check the boxes next to each of the intended recipients’ names. If you don't see one or more of your recipients’ names in this view, you can use the search function to find them. Once you have checked the boxes for all the intended recipients, select “Send email from template” at the bottom of the page, then click “Apply”. You will then see a view with all the available [[Templates#E-mail templates|email templates]]. Select the template you want to use, then click on “Create” at the bottom of this view. Next, modify the text from the template however you like. You can also add attachments or send the email to other people in CC or BCC. When you have finished making changes, click “Send”.\n\nSee also [[Send email from template|Send email from template]].\n\n==Create letter from template==\n'''Send letter from a template to one recipient'''<br>\nTo send someone a letter from a template, click on the name of the intended recipient. Click the link to “Create letter from template”. Select a [[Templates#Letter templates|letter template]] and click “Create”. This will take you to the view where you can open the created letter (next to the “Document” title) and print it out.\n\n'''Send letter from a template to multiple recipients'''<br>\nTo send a letter from a template to multiple recipients, check the boxes next to each of the intended recipients’ names. If you don't see one or more of your recipients’ names in this view, you can use the search function to find them. Once you have checked the boxes for all the intended recipients, select “Create letter(s) from template” at the bottom of the page, then click “Apply”. You will then see a view with all the available templates. Select the [[Templates#Letter templates|letter template]] you want to use, then click on “Create” at the bottom of this view. The letters are now created in the background, and you can continue to work. After a few moments, or after pressing the F5 key, you can download the letters from the “Form letters & print documents” tab in the “Communication” module.\n\nProvided you have a ZIP utility installed, clicking on the file will open a window with the letters you have created. If you do not have a ZIP utility installed, the simplest approach is to save the ZIP file on your hard drive. Open the letters by double-clicking on the individual Word documents. Select all the files in the folder and right-click with the mouse. Then select the “Print” command to print all the letters at once. You can also open and print each letter individually.\n\n\n[[File:Movie.gif]] [[Webinars|Webinars]]"

Click on an email’s title to see details for that mail. The specific error message is shown there.\n\n==Edit communication note==\nAfter clicking on “Save”, the person’s profile view appears again, and you will see a table containing all the communication notes that have already been created. You can edit a communication note at any time by clicking on its title. Then click on the tool next to the “Notes” header. Now you can edit and re-save all details of the note.\n\n==Resend or forward email==\n\n[[File:info.gif]] More information under: [[Communication#Resend or forward email (Haufe Applicant Management)|Communication]]\n\n==[[File:Schloss_16.png]] Who sees what?==\n* [[#Im Haufe Bewerbermanagement|Applicant Management]]\n* [[#Im Haufe Mitarbeitermanagement|Employee management]]\n\n===In Haufe Applicant Management===\nIn general, the sections (URLs) ''/Recruiting/Applications/ID/ID/Contacts'' and ''/Contact/Contacts'' in Applicant Management contain communications data.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The visibility of these data generally depends on which branch office the user belongs to, or whether or not the user has a branch office restriction.\n \n* '''User with <u>no</u> branch office restriction'''\n: Users with no branch office restriction can see all data, i.e. every message that is created/sent/received.\n\n* '''User <u>with</u> a branch office restriction'''\n: Users with a branch office restriction see communications relating to applications for their assigned branch office.\n\n===In Haufe Employee Management===\nURL: ''/Communications/Contacts''\n\n'''In general, what you see here does not include:'''\n* reminder emails that were sent on a reminder's due date\n* password emails (for security reasons)\n* emails containing login data\n* automatic emails to job board\n\nIn general, '''all''' emails are shown in the communication history, i.e. including automatic emails to job boards, reminder emails that were sent on a reminder’s due date, etc. Likewise, emails with direct links that were previously filtered out are now shown, but the links in the emails are removed. This prevents sensitive data from becoming visible to unauthorized users. <br> The access rights that a user has due to their [[Communication history#Basic roles|basic role]] remain unchanged.

						"__text": "[[Category:Employee management|Employee management]]\n[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[Category:Settings|Settings]]\n[[de:Anpassungsmodus]]\nConfiguration mode, formerly called CWC mode (for Customer Web Configuration), allows you to display and hide [[Customize views|views of your solution]] such as single elements, and to configure texts, forms, links, [[Containers|containers]], and tables however you prefer. The Hide and [[Configuration mode#Display and hide elements|Display]] functions also can be configured separately via [[Modules & Accesses#Role groups for special view configurations|Role groups for special view configurations]]. Please note that not all available CWC settings work everywhere — for instance, the configurations for document lists are very limited.\n\n[[File:Attention.gif]] Please note that you can only use the configuration mode to configure your solution. That means your solution can only be configured, but '''not''' used in the normal way. For example, you cannot save forms in configuration mode. When you are done editing the configuration, exit the configuration mode to continue working normally in your Umantis solution. \n\nYou will find the configuration mode at the top right of the main menu bar. As an administrator, you can click on \"Configure view\" to modify individual elements.\n\n==Important information and tips for configuration mode==\nConfiguration mode (CWC mode) is a very powerful tool for configuring existing solutions — but certain configuration changes might also break the solution or render it unusable. The configurations can sometimes have extremely critical consequences, and we therefore recommend that configuration mode only be used by users who are fully aware of the consequences. Furthermore, '''every configuration should be tested''' after completion, and its effects/results checked. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Conditions:''' Note that certain elements can be seen in configuration mode which may not be displayed outside of configuration mode. These elements are linked to certain specific conditions, and are only displayed when those conditions are met. \n\nHere are some tips and some typical examples of changes in configuration mode that may have '''critical consequences''':\n\n* '''“Search” must not be hidden when search links (e.g. “open applications” on the homepage) are enabled for display.'''\n: Effect: Search link no longer functions properly.\n\n* '''Do not display multiple search fields with the same name'''\n: Searches with the same name should never be displayed at the same time (e.g. on the job board). This situation would lead to incorrect behavior in all searches. \n\n* '''Do not hide important fields: Password field, login name field, email field etc.'''\t\n:Effect: Hiding these important fields may result in an applicant no longer having cockpit access, or login may no longer be possible, etc. \n\n* '''When creating jobs or job requisitions, the ''Branch office'' field should not be hidden.'''\n: Effect: Various incorrect behavior.\n\n* '''Renaming selection values that cannot be renamed'''\n: Certain selection values cannot be deleted because they are permanently linked to actions in the solution (e.g. the application status \"Application submitted\" is automatically assigned to all new applications). Any selection value that cannot be deleted should therefore be renamed in an '''informative way''', if at all.\n\n* '''Only perform general renaming for specific words (e.g. do not rename \"Comment\" across the board)'''\t\n:Effect: Incorrect labels.\n\n* '''Do not set email fields to “display”'''\n: Display fields do not store any data — they are used to prevent the user from editing the content of the field (see [[#Formular anpassen|Configure form]]).\n\n* '''Generally, use drilldown entry fields only for filters and searches'''\n: Drilldown entry fields can be defined at various places in the solution. However, they are not appropriate for setting values, but are mainly used for filters and searches.\n\n* '''cwc dummy'''\n: As an administrator, you will find various content elements that are filled in with “cwc dummy”. These make configuration easier by allowing you to configure tables and other content elements even when no real content is present on the specific screen in question. This can be especially helpful for screens for which an administrator has no jurisdiction (e.g. due to their role).\n\n==Display and hide elements==\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Notes:''' \n* If certain data blocks are displayed twice in configuration mode, this is valid behavior, not an error. Each data block is linked to conditions and must be displayed twice in configuration mode in order to allow for changes to be applied. \n* Please note that there are certain dependencies between the different views/screens. Therefore, you should never hide the navigation elements at the top level or the first sub-level, for example, as this can lead to display problems. \n\n'''Basics''': Every element can be individually displayed or hidden. However, fields may be duplicated in some forms; in this case, only one element should be displayed.\n\n* Click on the [[File:Cwcvisibleoff.gif]] icon to hide or display the element: \n**The hidden element always has an orange background in configuration mode and is accompanied by the following icon: [[File:Cwcvisibleoff.gif]]. \n**The displayed element does not have an orange background in configuration mode and is accompanied by the following icon: [[File:Cwcvisibleon.gif]]\n* Click on the [[File:config.gif]] to go to the configuration page. Under the \"Visibility\" menu item, the element can be displayed or hidden by selecting or deselecting the checkbox. If you have defined special [[Modules & Accesses#Role groups for special view configurations|role groups]] in the settings, these can be activated separately using the \"Hide [[Configuration mode#Special settings|special settings]]\" checkbox. If this box is checked, the element is no longer displayed for the specified role groups.\n* In addition, there are also so-called '''display fields'''. These are form fields which are displayed but do not allow the user to make changes or enter data. Please note that display fields do not save any data; for example, email fields should therefore never be set to “display”. \n: In Configuration mode, you can activate/deactivate display fields for various fields, either for all users (\"Display/Input\"), or only for the specified [[View texts#Role groups for special view configurations|Role groups for special view configurations]] (\"Display/Input ([[Configuration mode#Special settings|Special settings]])\"). For example, if you set the email address field for an employee to “display” (Employee -> Employee Directory), then the email address can no longer be changed at this location — either by all users or only by the defined role groups. If empty fields are set to Display, they will no longer be shown. <br>Another example: You want to display documents about the job in the employee profile, but you may not want to allow the employee to upload their own documents. In this case, we recommend that rather than hiding the upload fields completely, you set the corresponding field to ''display'' . (If all fields for uploading documents are hidden, this affects the “show screen” and previously uploaded documents will not be shown.)\n\n==Configure texts and fields==\nThere are different configuration options for texts, forms, links, and tables. Once you have located the element that you would like to configure, click on the [[File:config.gif]] icon. \n\n===Icons===\nYou can use the following setting to activate icons for search links on the home page: \n\n'''Search links are icons:''' \n* Default\n* '''yes, show icons (true)'''\n* no, show text (false)\n\nIf you activate icons, you will then see default icons, which you can further modify by clicking on the gear ([[File:Config.gif]]) next to the given icon. To select a different icon, enter the ID of the desired symbol from the linked library in the '''Font Icon Name''' field.\n\n===User-defined fields===\nYou will find ''user-defined'' fields at various places in the Umantis solution. These fields are provided in addition to Umantis “default fields” and can be customized.\n\n===Modify the order of elements===\nIn configuration mode, you can modify the order of elements using [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_and_Drop Drag & Drop]:\n* Left-click on an element and, holding down the mouse button, drag the element to the desired position and drop it there.\n* Once you have changed the Umantis default order, a button to '''Reset element order''' is displayed in the top area. If you click on this button, the original Umantis default order is restored.\n \nYou can define a specific order using this function. This is especially helpful for forms that include a large number of user-defined fields.  <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:'''<br>\n* Changes in the order of elements should be carried out consistently in all associated forms. \n* Moving items below the associated buttons (e.g. Save, Cancel, Search etc.) is not possible.\n* Table rows and columns cannot be moved.\n\n===Configure text===\nPractically any text in the solution can be customized in every language. This includes labels (for fields), help texts, icon \"alt texts\", column titles, headers, and navigation elements.\n\n* If you want to rename an element and the new name is only to be applied at this location, enter the new name and place a check mark next to \"Specific renaming\" (under \"Editable attributes\"). Otherwise the new name will be applied throughout the entire solution, regardless of the context in which it appears. It is therefore recommended that you rename items globally by searching for the term with the \"[[View texts|View texts]]\" search function.\n\n* You can also configure texts for [[Multiple actions|multiple actions]] (MultiAction). These fields are dropdown lists which you can edit by clicking on the [[File:config.gif]] icon (right next to the list). The individual texts for the actions can be displayed, hidden, and renamed, both generally and for the defined role groups. Multiple actions should, however, only be renamed in a logical manner, as the underlying functions remain unchanged.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] The white box in the upper right corner in configuration mode allows you to change the language. Regardless of the active language settings, the texts can all be set to any language.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] To undo a change made manually, save the input field with no value. Before saving, check that the input field is truly empty and does not contain a space; otherwise, the space will be displayed in place of the original text.\n\n===Role-specific visibilities===\n''[[File:attention.gif]] Note that [[User roles in Applicant Management|Administrators]] is always granted access, regardless of role or other permissions defined here.''\n\nYou can restrict the visibility of individual elements (form fields for entry and search), [[Containers|containers]], and table columns to specific roles:\n* In configuration mode, click on [[File:Config.gif]] for each item (container or table column) and use the section \"'''Roles that can see this element'''\" to specify the roles to which visibility is to be limited.\n====In Umantis Employee Management====\nIn configuration mode, you can limit visibility either on the '''[[User roles in the employee management system#User roles|user role]] level''': \n:* Administrator (''system administrator'')\n:* HR (''HR expert'' also includes ''Manager'' role)\n:* Superior plus OrgUnits (''Manager with access to direct subordinates and other organizational units'')\n:* Superior (''Manager'') \n:* Employee (''Employees'')\n\n: Or directly at the '''[[User roles in the employee management system#Access to modules|module]] level:'''\n:* Employee file (''Employee file'')\n:* Salary and bonus (''all salary/bonuses'') \n:* Goals and tasks (''for ERM'')\n:* Personnel development (''for ERM'')\n:* Succession planning (''Succession planning'')\n:* Applicant management (''Applicant Management'')\n:* Event administrator (''manages events'')\n:* Network administrator (''manages networks'')\n:* Survey administrator (''Surveys'')\n\n====In Umantis Applicant Management====\nIn configuration mode, you can limit visibility either on the '''[[User roles in Applicant Management|user role]] level''': \n:* Administrator\n:* HR expert\n:* HR assistant\n\n: Or directly on the '''access permissions level:'''\n:* Administer HR experts and HR assistants\n:* Administer hiring managers\n:* Administer committee members\n:* Administer recruiters\n:* Publishing jobs\n:* Administer job requisitions and approval\n:* Administer appointments\n:* Administer applications\n:* Administer assessments\n:* Administer central templates\n:* Use analytics\n:* Start job and application imports\n:* Sensitive data \n:: [[File:info.gif]] The \"Sensitive data\" field is a sort of \"template\" which, unlike the other values, is not pre-configured. You might use \"Sensible data\" permissions for salary information, for example. \n:''[[File:attention.gif]] Note that [[User roles in Applicant Management|Administrators]] is always granted access, regardless of role or other permissions defined here.'' \n\n====[[File:info.gif]] Example - Sensitive data====\nYou have an HR assistant who performs certain tasks but who should not have access to '''sensitive data'''. You can define their permissions in the [[Users overview (Applicant Management)|User overview]] when you add the new HR assistant to the system, or with existing/active HR assistants. Select all entries in the [[Users overview (Applicant Management)#Roles and permissions|Roles and permissions]] section '''except''' for the permission: \"Sensitive data\". \n\nAs per ''“Role-specific visibility”,'' you can then restrict the visibility of individual elements, containers,, and table columns:  \n* If there are certain sections of the solutions which you consider sensitive and do '''not''' want to display to this HR assistant, use configuration mode and check the “Sensitive data” box under''Roles that can see this element''for each sensitive element. \n* The visibility is then restricted to only those HR experts and HR assistants who have \"Sensitive data\" permissions.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that in extreme cases, the administrator can set up a very complex permissions structure (if a company has '''many''' HR experts and HR assistants working for it). This is not advisable. Use the approach that works best for you, and avoid excessive restrictions and overly complex interactions among the permissions and visibilities assigned to different people.\n\n===Configure form===\nThe following attributes can be defined for certain fields in forms: \n\n* '''Input for display'''\n: Form fields are generally used for entering data. If the user should not be allowed to edit a given field, the field can be set to “display”.\n\n*'''Type of input field''' \n:* For text fields, the size of the text field can be set from “TextArea5Rows” (small) to “TextArea25Rows” (large).\n:* For selection list fields, see the section on how to [[#Eingabeart für Auswahllisten anpassen|Configure entry method for selection lists]].\n\n* '''Type of display in profile'''\n: Indicate here whether and how items should be displayed in the profile.\n:* default: display occurs depending on the individual field\n:* not displayed\n:* displayed without label: displayed without ''Original content Label''\n:* displayed completely\n\n* '''Error correction during entry'''\n: Several conditions can be defined for entries.\n:*Required: The user must enter a value\n:*Not required: Entering a value is not required\n:*Check [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Media_Type MIME type]: When saving the field, the uploaded document is checked against the permitted file format (defined in [[Security settings|Security Settings]]). If the format does not match, an error message is displayed.\n:*Check on uniqueness: The entry may only occur once in the form\n:*Only decimal numbers: Only decimal numbers are permitted\n:*Only integer numbers: Only whole numbers are permitted\n:*Only lowercase: Only lowercase letters and numbers are permitted\n:*No spaces: Spaces are not permitted\n:*Only a-z, A-Z, 0–9: Only individual letters or numbers are permitted\n\n* '''Allow HTML'''\n: Indicate whether HTML should be interpreted or not. See the instructions in the [[#Datenfelder anpassen - HTML Sicherheitseinschränkung|Configure data fields — HTML security restriction]] section.\n:* default\n:* interpret HTML\n:* do not interpret HTML\n\n* '''Turn off HTML editor'''\n: The HTML editor appears only in TextArea fields that interpret HTML. Select “no editor” to turn off the HTML editor.\n\n* [[#Rollenspezifische Sichtbarkeiten|Roles that can see this element]]\n\n* '''Shortcut key'''\n: A user can enter a letter or number here to create a shortcut, which can later be used to jump directly to the field with the following key combination: \n:* Internet Explorer & Chrome:  <Alt> + <Kurztaste> OR <Alt> + <Shift> + <Kurztaste>\n:* Mozilla Firefox: <Alt> + <Shift> + <Kurztaste>\n: [[File:attention.gif]] ''Please note that the key combinations may vary depending on which browser you are using.''\n: [[File:info.gif]] The shortcut keys are visible as anchors and can be read by screen readers.\n\n* '''Helpful links'''\n: [[Application form & application folder in applicant management system|Application forms & application documents in Applicant Management]]\n\n===Configure entry method for selection lists===\n*In configuration mode, any multi-select list can be converted into a single-select list. \n\n*Conversely, '''certain single-select lists can be converted to multi-select lists'''.\n\n*The following list types can be selected under \"Input field type\":\n**'''Multiselect lists / Checkboxes''': List or checkboxes in which one or more options may be selected. The selection can be defined by the number of rows.\n**'''Single-select dropdown / radio button''': Dropdown list or list of option fields — only one option can be selected.\n::* '''Single-select dropdown, searchable''': Activate this list type to activate a search function within the input field. To use it, enter the first few characters, and you will immediately get suggestions for all the selection values that contain that sequence of characters. Searchable single-select dropdown lists can be especially useful for dropdown lists with a very large number of choices. \n\n::[[File:info.gif]] Within a type, the selection list can be changed as desired. For example, you can easily switch from \"Single-select dropdown\" to \"Single-select radio button\".\n\n:*'''Drilldown entry fields:''' These input fields are used for navigating through hierarchical data; as such, they can be used for filters and searches (but not for setting values).\n:** ''Drilldown Multiselect All Levels Selectable'' — allows multi-select at all levels\n:** ''Drilldown Multiselect Lowest Levels Selectable'' — allows multi-select at the lowest level\n:** ''Drilldown Singleselect All Levels Selectable'' — allows single select at all levels\n:** ''Drilldown Singleselect Lowest Levels Selectable'' — allows single select at the lowest level\n\n[[File:info.gif]] A maximum of 2000 entries can be applied to settings in multiselect field customization mode, otherwise performance problems may occur in the browser.\n\n===Configure data fields -— HTML security restriction===\nBy default, all data fields in Umantis applications are subject to certain security restrictions, therefore e.g. only specific HTML formats are permitted. Unauthorized HTML commands or scripts (e.g. JavaScript) are blocked. However, since it still makes sense to disable these limitations for certain applications, configuration mode can be used to define individual fields as '''“unsecured”''' or '''“unrestricted”''' (not recommended). The contents are then no longer verified.  \n\n[[File:info.gif]] For instance, one situation where this type of reduced restriction might be useful is when [[Format writing#Allow images from external sources (not recommended)|uploading images]] via WYSIWYG text editor.\n\n'''Fields''' that can be set to '''\"unsecured\"''' or '''\"unrestricted\"''':\n\n* Publication contents for external and internal job postings\n* Signature & footer\n* Emails (certain emails e.g. system emails, email templates etc.)\n* Privacy policy statements\n* Wizards (certain content such as title, text, help, and description)\n* Job boards (activation and deactivation emails)\n\n===Configure table===\nWhen configuring a table (using the [[File:config.gif]] icon in the top left corner of the table), you can define the number of rows displayed per table. The default value is 15 (rows). You can also select the column which determines default sorting. <br>[[File:info.gif]] To avoid performance issues, you should keep the \"Number of rows displayed\" low — typically no more than 25.\n\n* You can specify whether the content of a given column should be combined with the next column by using''' \"Combine this column with the next\"'''.\n* Using''' \"Separator between combined elements\"''', you specify whether the combined values in this cell are to be separated visually with a space or with a certain symbol/letter etc. of your choice. You can use HTML to do this. For example, if the separator you specify is a comma (,) followed by a line break, i.e. if you enter <nowiki>\" ,<br> \"</nowiki> as your separator, two or more values in the affected cell will be separated by a comma followed by a line break.\n: [[File:Info.gif]] Be careful not to combine similar contents with each other in this way. For example, if one value remains empty, only the other (non-empty) value will be displayed, and it is no longer clear whether this belongs to the first or second column.\n* '''Hide edit and delete column''' \n: Select this option to hide the edit and delete option.\n\n==== Column width====\nIn the section \"Column width\" you have the possibility to enter a value between 1px and 999px to define a specific column width.\n\n====Load more lines dynamically====\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that dynamic loading is only possible for pages that are not integrated via iFrame.\n\nWhen configuring tables for the main views (via [[File:config.gif]]), you can choose to check the box for '''Load more lines dynamically'''. This activates the dynamic loading of additional lines, thus simplifying the selection of multiple entries from this table (and executing multiple actions).<br>\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] When the \"Load more lines dynamically\" function is activated, the settings under \"'''Number of lines displayed'''\" will be ignored. Instead, 10 lines will be shown, and 10 more lines will be loaded when the user scrolls down. Loading occurs three times. After that, you can click on [[File:Infinite_1.png|30px]] to load additional lines (10 at a time).\n\n* [[File:Infinite_1.png]] — Click on this arrow at the bottom of the table to load 10 more lines. \n\n* [[File:Infinite_2.png]] — Click on this icon to jump to the last entry. If you then scroll up, previous entries will be loaded. \n: If the last entries in the table are being displayed (rather than the first ones), this icon will appear at the left (and pointing in the other direction).\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Once activated, dynamic loading of entries is also available in the \"Card View\".\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The \"Load more lines dynamically\" function can also be activated for tables in the detailed views (e.g. in the applicant overview for a job — ''/Recruiting/Vacancies/ID/Selection''). In this case, additional table entries are loaded not by scrolling, but by clicking. The reason is that most detailed views include a large number of elements. Dynamically loading table entries by scrolling would push elements under the table further and further down on the page.\n\n===Configure link===\nVarious details can be specified for fields with links (using the [[File:config.gif]] icon on the left next to the column header): \n* '''Link target''': The link target fields serve as links within the system, and therefore only the extension (everything after \"umantis.com\") needs to be specified. Refer to the original link (original content in the comment under the \"Link target\" field) to see the values that you can use as placeholders for the numbers (IDs) in the different URLs. \n: To insert a link target:\n:* In [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], find the relevant link and click on [[File:config.gif]] \n:* Enter the URL under \"Link target\" (e.g. ''/Employment/ProzessA''). \n\n: [[File:Attention.gif]] '''Note:''' Since search links perform a search in the background and display the search result in the appropriate overview, link targets should only be configured if you understand exactly what search is performed by the search link (and whether the search is displayed).\n\nFor links to external sites, be sure to write out the complete link, beginning with <nowiki>http://www...</nowiki>\n\n* '''Open link in new window?''': When this option is selected, the linked site will open in a new window. With \"Default\" preselected, the browser controls this automatically.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] See also [[User-defined links|User-defined links]]\n\n==Configure login pages==\nIt is possible to customize the login page specifically for individual users. To do so, use the following links:\n* Administrator view: ''recruitingapp-XXX.umantis.com/Login''\n* User view for employees: ''recruitingapp-XXX.umantis.com/SelfService/MyProfile/Login''\n* Hiring manager: ''recruitingapp-XXX.umantis.com/SelfServiceLine/MyProfile/Login''\n* Board Member: ''recruitingapp-XXX.umantis.com/SelfServiceBoard/MyProfile/Login''\n\n==Hide search box on job board==\nIt is also possible to hide the entire search box in the job board. To do this, use the following CSS code:<br>\n<nowiki>.icon.iab_hide::before {\n    display: none;\n}\n\ndiv.container_actionbar_sh_AB {\n    display: none;\n}\n</nowiki>\n\n==Special settings==\nWhatever is entered for the two special settings '''Hide (special setting)''' and '''Display / Input (special setting)''' applies only to the [[Modules & Accesses|Role group for special view configurations]] defined in the settings. [[File:Schloss_16.png]]\nBy default, all fields can be edited by all users and all entries are permitted. However, if a field is globally set to [[Configuration mode#Display and hide elements|Display]] under “Display/Input”, then no changes can be made by the user. Similarly, for predefined [[Modules & Accesses|role groups]] such as “HR expert” and “Administrator”, the field can be set separately to “Display” using the Configuration mode menu item “Display / Input (Special Setting)”, so that only these role groups are prevented from editing the field.\n==More tips from consultants==\n[[File:Info.gif]] If you cannot edit certain texts in configuration mode, it could be that you are working on an element of the so-called [[Selection lists#Fixed lists|fixed lists]]. Certain system-controlled texts appear as fixed lists so that they can be correctly displayed depending on the language. An example of this are the \"Employee review meeting\" areas on the \"Overall assessment\" page.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] Upload fields should not be defined as required fields or mandatory fields (mandatory fields: see under [[Configuration mode#Configure forms|Error correction during entry]]) in configuration mode / entry mode, as this will trigger an error message.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] If you would like to configure the applicant, hiring manager or recruiter views, you can open a second browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, if you already have Internet Explorer open) and log in as the desired role. This lets you see how these areas appear to users in that role. If you want to configure a view, copy its Internet address into the address bar of the browser window where you are logged in as an administrator, and perform the configuration there.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] However, if you would like to configure a view for committee members (/SelfServiceBoard), your administrator access must first be assigned to a committee. After administrator access has been assigned, all you need to do is to release a job and an applicant to this committee member, and you can then make changes as usual.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] If you would like to make changes to pages that are accessed via links sent with tokens (?Key=), proceed as follows: Delete \"?Key= Parameter\" from the link and log in as an administrator, or copy the link without \"?Key= Parameter\" into the address bar of the browser window where you are already logged in as an administrator. \nExample URL for third parties without access (SelfServiceAppraisals):\n\n/SelfServiceAppraisals/ID/Profile/Applications/ID/Profile/Appraisals/ID/EditAppraisal?Key=8663aa03e3f60e640342e6711d72fcad&customer=ID&lang=fre \nDelete \"Key=8663aa03e3f60e640342e6711d72fcad\" from the link.\n\nLog in as administrator and add the changed link: \n/SelfServiceAppraisals/ID/Profile/Applications/ID/Profile/Appraisals/ID/EditAppraisal?&customer=ID&lang=fre\n\n==Common problems in Configuration mode==\nIf Configuration mode is not working, or if no changes can be made, follow this procedure:\n# Empty the [[Emptying the browser cache|cache]], i.e. delete everything in the URL after “xxx.umantis.com/” and enter “?clearCache=true” in its place to force the cache to be emptied.\n# Check whether [[Modules & Accesses#Role groups for special view configurations|Role groups for special view configurations]] have been applied; if so, remove them.\n# Enter a [[Send a new password|New administrator password]].<br>"

These settings are configured by your (setup) administrator.\n\n====Calculate height automatically====\n“Calculate height automatically” causes the height of the container to be calibrated automatically. This function is especially useful when integrating event templates, since the height of the field is then automatically adjusted to fit the information provided for a given event.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that for certain [[Diagrams / Dashboards / Charts|diagrams]], the '''Calculate height automatically''' option may cause the display size to continually increase. If you observe this behavior, please deactivate this option."

A job posting layout is defined in an HTML file which is then uploaded to the solution. Any files (e.g. images, documents etc.) that are used in the HTML layout must also be uploaded with the corresponding layout. The layout then needs to be assigned to a branch office.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that when using a newly created job posting layout, there may be a delay of up to 10 minutes before the new job posting layout can be displayed correctly. \n\n==Important==\n[[File:attention.gif]] We use a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy content security policy], which can lead to issue with certain JavaScript used in the publication layout, e.g. onclick, onmouseover, onmouseout, etc. To avoid these issues, a script in the header of the HTML-page needs to be added. \n\nTo avoid such problems, you should ensure that such functions are set up in a CSP-compliant manner. You can see a suitable example script here: \n\n'''Example:'''\n\n <!DOCTYPE html>\n <html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Print this job</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <nowiki><!-- First define the HTML element, e.g. the Apply-Button --></nowiki>\n        <button class=\"button\" type=\"button\" id=\"print-button\">Print</button>\n        <nowiki><!-- After that specify what JavaScript needs to happen on that button (best practice: place the script tag at the end of the document, right before the closing body-tag) --></nowiki>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            $(document).ready(function() {\n                document.getElementById('print-button').addEventListener('click', function() {window.print();});\n            });\n        </script>\n    </body>\n </html>\n\n==Example job posting==\nAn example of a possible job posting layout in HTML format is provided [[Media:Umantis_onlinehelp_example_advertisement_layout.zip‎|here]]. The template also includes examples of variables that you can use in the HTML file. Further down, you will find an example job posting created in accordance with [[#Tipps & Beispiele für barrierefreie Stelleninserate|accessibility guidelines]].\n\n==Integrating attachments==\nAttachments are also integrated into the job posting layout using [[Variables|variables]]. Within the HTML template, the following notation ([[Variables|variables]]) can be used as a placeholder for an attachment:\n* [document.attachement1] ''for attachment 1''\n* [document.attachement2] ''for attachment 2''\n...\n* [document.attachement5] ''for attachment 5''\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the corresponding files must be uploaded to the solution.\n\n<br>\n''Example:''<br>\nThe following example shows how an image file can be integrated into a layout using variables. The URL for attachment 1 is inserted into the HTML “img” tag.\n  <nowiki>\n<img src='[document.attachement1]'>\n  </nowiki>\nThe same applies for any links you might want to add.\n\n==Listing items in HTML lists==\nThe following HTML code may be useful if you want to create an ordered HTML list using bullet points (●). For this to work, “-” characters must already be used to mark list items, since the code replaces them with bullet points (●).<br><br>\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] In order for the code below to work, the “tick-points” class should be defined in the HTML code’s header. ''[Inserat.Text1]'' is part of the job posting text.\n\n <nowiki>\n[TempTextLines = Inserat.Text1 | replace('<br />', '<replaceASAP><br />')]\n[TextLines = TempTextLines.split('<br />')]\n[FOREACH TextLine IN TextLines]\n\t[IF TextLine.match('^-')]\n\t\t<ul class=\"trick_points\"><li class=\"trick_points\">\n\t\t\t[TextLine | remove('^-') | replace('<replaceASAP>', '')]\n\t\t</li></ul>\n\t[ELSE]\n\t\t[TextLine | replace('<replaceASAP>', '<br />')]\n\t[END]\n[END]\n  </nowiki>\n\n\n'''Example''': <br>\n:The job posting text for the list:\n::- Item 1<br>\n::- Item 2\n\n:will appear as \n\n::● Item 1<br>\n::● Item 2\n\n:when the HTML code is used.\n\n==Integrating Google Maps==\nYou can use Google Maps to easily integrate a map into a job posting. Using the map, applicants can quickly get a sense of where they would potentially be working and how to get there. The map shows routes, distances and estimated travel times for different modes of transportation (car, public transport, etc.).<br/>\nIf necessary, this feature can be configured so that the full set of route-planning features are displayed.\n<br>\n[[File:GoogleMaps.PNG‎]]\n\n===Technical information about integrating Google Maps===\n* [[Technical integration of Google Maps|Technical integration of Google Maps]]\n<br>\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n* If you want '''search engines''' (Google, Bing etc.) to index your jobs, they must be able to find them. Therefore, add appropriate “meta” tags in the Head section of the job posting. These meta tags are included in the example above, and can be adapted to your needs.\n\n===Tips and examples for accessible job postings===\nThe following notes and tips will help you to create [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrierefreiheit accessible] job postings (Applicant Management) or publication and print designs (Employee Management).\n\nUse the '''new''' example template saved in the ZIP file for an accessible job posting layout: [[Media:Layout_example.zip|Layout (example)]], which is referred to in the discussion below (''In the job posting''). You can compare this template with the “non-accessible” old version (also included in the ZIP file). \n\n; Alt text for UI elements\nGUI elements should have alternative text, or “alt text”, associated with them. Linked graphics, menus and logos must use the link target as the alt text. The alt text for buttons must name the action associated with the button. Alt text is mainly important for visually impaired users, and for users who turn off the loading of graphics for faster access. In these cases, the alt text is displayed instead of the graphical element.\n\n* In the example job posting (example template), the UI elements in the carousel, and the social media symbols are the ones that most require alt text:\n: Carousel: The “prev” and “next” texts had no alt text: “alt” -> Attribute was added with a helpful description \n: Social media symbols: No alternative texts are provided\n\n; Alt text for graphics and objects\nInformative graphics and images should have associated alt texts. The alt text replaces the image and should take over its “job”. \n* In the job posting: \n: The pictures under _YourTeam_ have no alt text (“alt” attribute)\n\n; Adequate text contrast\nAll texts on the page should have adequate light/dark contrast. They should also be visible for users with impaired color vision. For pages that use a style switcher to offer a version with adequate contrast, it must also be verified whether the default style meets the minimum requirements for text contrast.\n\n* In the job posting: \n: Pay attention to the contrast ratio between the background color and the font color, so that the text is also legible for people with reduced vision or on black and white monitors.\n: The tool for measuring contrast ratios can be downloaded here: https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/CCA-Win/releases/\n\n; Usable without a mouse\nThe web page should be usable without a mouse and exclusively with the keyboard, or without a keyboard and exclusively with the mouse. Other special devices behave similarly to a mouse or keyboard.\nVisually impaired users and users with motor impairments rely on these usability options.\n* In the job posting: \n: “Video” and “Carousel” should be usable without a mouse. To do this, the control for the YouTube video must be activated and the tab indexes must be set. The tab indexes must be set correctly for the carousel.\n\n; Meaningful link texts\nThe target or purpose of the link should be apparent from the link text. For visually impaired users who [http://www.barrierefreies-webdesign.de/knowhow/tabindex/ tab] from link to link, the link texts are read aloud to the user. Using meaningful link texts makes it easier for these users to decide if they want to follow a certain link. If the link text itself is not clearly meaningful in this sense, it should at least be easy for users of screen readers to determine the immediate context.\n\n* In the job posting: \n: The “prev” and “next” links in the carousel must be language-dependent. In a job posting in German, for example, “prev” and “next” must be translated correctly.\n\n; Current focus position is clear\nThe keyboard focus must be highlighted at least as clearly as the mouse focus.\n\n* In the job posting: \n: Example for links:\n a:hover, a:focus {\n color: #a62662;\n }\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Advertisement layouts|Job posting layouts]]\n* [[Technical integration of Google Maps|Technical integration of Google Maps]]"

However, you should ensure that no formatting begins or ends in the middle of a variable - i.e. between the square brackets. Otherwise, in the background MS Word will save the formatting information in the middle of the variable, and Haufe will no longer recognize the variable.\n*  If your template starts with a variable (e.g. [Sender.Name]), Word automatically takes the first characters in the document as the description of the file properties. Because the bracket has not been closed correctly, this results in an empty document. Overwrite the description in the file properties with a text without a variable, and re-save the document.\n*  If there are images in the template and it is saved as an RTF, they will be very large and they will also be very large in any letters and print views that are created. This will slow down the generation of letters and print views. [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] This can be avoided by selecting the \"Compress images\" option beside the Save button in the \"Save as\" dialogue in \"Tools\", and selecting the degree of compression you want."

The part of the URL which is relevant for the assistant begins after ...umantis.com. Parameters and anchors can be used but are not mandatory. \n\nIn the URLs of the individual pages, replace the numbers of the employees, the jobs, etc. with the expression '''[UrlID1]''', '''[UrlID2]''','''[UrlID3]''',... (from left to right including the square brackets!). When a step is triggered, the first number of the current address is filled as [UrlID1] of the triggered step, the second number to the job [UrlID2], etc...\n\nExample of employee profile: <nowiki>https://employeeapp-217.umantis.com/Employment/Current/125/Profile</nowiki>\n\n&gt; Copy to the field URL: '''/Employment/Current/[UrlID1]/Profile'''\n\nExample of overview of new applications: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-1067.umantis.com/Recruiting/Applications?searchCurrentStatus=2010&Search=1</nowiki>\n\n&gt; Copy to the field URL: '''/Recruiting/Applications?searchCurrentStatus=2010&Search=1'''\n\n===Step active if===\n\nBasically, a step is active if the conditions are in place so that the same number or more IDs (numbers) are in the current address as [UrlID]s are expected in the step's URL.\n\nA step can also be protected by defining that it cannot be selected before Step X or after Step Y.\n\n===Step title, text and help===\n\nA title '''A)''', a text '''B)''' and a detailed help '''C)''' can be defined for every step and each language. \n\n[[File:Assistent.png|Assistent.png]]\n\nThe help text always appears when the cursor hovers over the Info symbol, and sometimes as a separate Info box above the Actions bar on the left-hand side.

Upload the template you have created to Umantis, and give it a name. Click \"Save\" to return to the \"Templates\" tab in the overview, where the template you have just uploaded should appear at the top of the table.\n\n==Settings & access==\n*  In the print templates application, i.e. when you are creating one or more print views, you can filter according to the template '''language''' assigned.\n*  In employee management, you can set [[Control access to templates in employee management|who is permitted to use a template]] and in which additional areas (employees access, instructors access) the template is to be available for selection. [[File:Schloss_16.png|Schloss_16.png]] A template may be edited by anyone who has been assigned the Communication module role.\n*  In applicant management, the administrators and HR experts can see all of their branch offices' templates and are also permitted to configure them.\n\n==Tips from consultants==\n*  The easiest way to create a new print template is to copy an existing template and change the text.\n*  You can format a template in any way you want. However, you should ensure that no formatting begins or ends in the middle of a variable - i.e. between the square brackets. Otherwise, in the background MS Word will save the formatting information in the middle of the variable, and Umantis will no longer recognize the variable.\n*  If your template starts with a variable (e.g. [Sender.Name]), Word automatically takes the first characters in the document as the description of the file properties. Because the bracket has not been closed correctly, this results in an empty document. Overwrite the description in the file properties with a text without a variable, and re-save the document.\n*  If there are images in the template and it is saved as an RTF, they will be very large and they will also be very large in any letters and print views that are created. This will slow down the generation of letters and print views. [[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]] This can be avoided by selecting the \"Compress images\" option right next to the save button in the \"Save as\" dialogue box in \"Tools\", and select the degree of compression you want."

You can see there whether the applicant data import was successful. <br />\n[[File:Info.gif]] The applicant’s user language is automatically set to German, and must be changed manually if needed.<br />\n[[File:Info.gif]] The application import must be confirmed manually.\n\n== Email parsing: Import via email ==\n[[File:info.gif]] ''Please note that email parsing is an additional paid extension of Textkernel.''\n\nYou can also specify an email address to serve as a source of résumé imports. If you then send an email with an applicant’s CV as an attachment to the email address you chose to specify, that applicant will be automatically imported into your solution.\n===Preparation===\n* For the recommended '''default variant''', you only need to define '''one''' email address, which serves the following functions: \n** The specified email address is used for directly importing CVs that are attached to the emails (only one document per email). \n** CVs that cannot be parsed are also sent to this email address. \n** All attachments that are parsed, whether successfully or not, are forwarded to this address. As such, this email address also provides an archiving function.<br>\n\n* Instead of using just one email address simultaneously as a direct import, error and archive address, you also have the option to specify '''three''' email addresses for one function each: \n** A direct-import email address for directly importing CVs that are attached to the emails (only one document per email).\n** An error email address for CVs that cannot be parsed. \n** An email address for archiving purposes, to which all attachments are forwarded, whether parsed successfully or not.\n[[File:Info.gif]] If a parsed email has more than one attachment, the remaining attachments will be forwarded to the error email address.<br >\n\n=== Proceed as follows: ===\n* Send a new email to the email address you specified, or forward an existing email, with the attachment to be parsed. The number indicated in the subject line (if present) will automatically be treated as the job number during the parsing process.\n* Log in to your Textkernel Sourcebox (at https://staging.textkernel.nl/sourcebox/home.jsp) to review the parsed fields and make any necessary changes to them.\n* Once you have reviewed the fields, click on the [[File:Dokument_exportieren.png ]] icon (“Export document”) and the applicant will automatically be entered into Umantis.\n\n==Important general notes==\n* The position/job must exist in Umantis, and the job number is entered manually into Textkernel’s Extract! Only if the job number is correct can the applicant be correctly associated with the job.<br />\n* Even if certain elements of the [[Application forms|application form]] are hidden in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], those elements will be parsed anyway. In other words, if these fields are then enabled for display, their data will also be visible.<br />\n* The parsing should always be manually reviewed, and corrected if necessary, before sending it over to the Umantis solution.\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[Employee file|employee record]]<br />\n*[[IPM integration|IPM integration]]\n*[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]\n*[[Xing|Xing]]\n*[[Aconso - Digital personnel file|Aconso — Digital personnel files]]\n*[[Job board provider|Job platform providers]]\n*[[Video interview - Interview suite by viasto|Video interview — Interview suite by viasto]]"

The email template is named “''SystemTemplate_Ask4DataAgreement''”, and can be edited in the [[System e-mails|system emails]].<br />\nIf the applicant does not consent to the data release, they will be informed again when they next log in that they should confirm the release of their data.<br>\n\n[[File:GDPR.png|50px]] Note that applicants can '''change their [[Access for applicant#My Profile|data release settings]] at any time.''' This option is provided to help protect personally-identifiable data in accordance with the [[Information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]. \n\nFor external event participants (Employee Management), the data release setting can be displayed directly in the registration form. The “Data release” and “Privacy policy statement” sections can also be displayed in the external individual’s profile (''/MyPublic/Profile''). See also: [[Access as an external person|Access as an external individual]]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The data release links on the home page in [[Applicant management main page|Applicant Management]] and [[Employee Management home page|Employee Management]] help you to keep track of the data release settings. \n\n===Request data release===\nThe link to “Request data release” is displayed if the applicant has not approved the data release.\n\n==Information regarding the cookie banner==\nWhen accessing a web page, a banner will usually be displayed with information about the use of cookies.  \n\n'''Example:'''\n: “''We save information about your visit using cookies”. By using this website, you consent to the use of cookies. You can reject the use of cookies, and adjust your browser setting accordingly. For detailed information about the use of cookies, please refer to our privacy policy statement (link to company-specific privacy policy statement)''  \n: >> This information can be confirmed using a button (most often: “understood”). \n\nThe design and integration of such a banner is usually carried out by the relevant web designer (Java script). It is displayed on the company’s website accordingly. In the Umantis context, the display of such a banner on external sites is indeed possible, but should be “covered” by the website banner already defined by the web designer. For example, if you have integrated a (Umantis) job board directly into your company's website (cf. [[External appearance#Integration type|type of integration]]), such a banner should only be displayed to the visitor in one place and not twice. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you would still like to display information regarding the use of cookies on external sites of your Umantis solution, then this is possible via ''/Administration/WebTrackingSettings''. Here you can integrate in the “Tracking Code Snippet” section the Java script supplied by your web designer and place a checkmark at “''Only integrate tracking code snippet in external sites''”."

If no explicit reference number is assigned, the ''Job ID'' is automatically used as the reference number.\n\n* '''Job ID''' (''Stelle.ID''): The Job ID refers to an identification key (ID) for a job that is assigned by the system (internally).

The provided diagram templates can be a very useful tool in this process. Examples for integrating diagrams are given further down.\n\n==Diagram templates==\n\nThe [[Reports|Analytics]] tab includes a number of different diagram templates. The table of existing diagram templates includes columns with the following icons at the right:\n\n* [[File:Diagramm Testansicht.png]]- Click on this icon to see the diagram test view.\n* [[File:Diagramm SQL.png]]- Click on this icon to show the SQL result.\n* [[File:Attention.gif]]- This icon indicates an invalid SQL request.\n* [[File:Umantis.gif]]- This icon is shown next to each Haufe default diagram.\n\nYou can also [[Create new diagram template|create new diagram templates]]of your own.\n\n==Integrate diagram using diagram templates==\n\nYou can use the existing diagram templates to present specific diagrams in areas like \"Diagrams about the employee\" (under [[Reports|Analytics]]  ). Use the following example instructions for such cases:\n\n# In the overview table of diagram templates, click on a specific diagram to access the [[Diagram template details|diagram template details]] .\n# Scroll down to configure type settings and permissions (EM), then click on [[File:Edit.GIF]]. This will bring you to the configuration mode for this diagram.\n# You can specify the following points for the diagram:\n#* '''Diagram type'''<br> ''Specify where the diagram should be displayed. In this example: \"Employee (Positions)\"''\n#* '''Position'''<br>''Specifies the order within a diagram type'' \n#* '''Displayed table'''<br> ''Specify here which of the three tables should appear alongside the diagram.''\n#* '''Visible to User Type (AM)'''<br> ''Select which user types can see the chart/report. Selection options: Applicant, Job Subscriber, Recruiter, Person with user profile. No selection means visible to all / no restriction. \n#* '''Visible for Role (AM)'''<br> ''Select which [[User roles in Applicant Management|User Roles]] can see the chart/report. No selection means visible to all / no restriction. \n#* '''Visible to module users (EM only)'''<br>''Indicates which module users will see this diagram when selecting from available diagrams of the diagram type indicated above. If nothing is selected, then this will be interpreted as \"no restriction\", and the diagram will be visible to everyone.''\n#* '''Visible for role (EM only)'''<br> ''Indicates which people in this role will see this diagram when selecting from available diagrams of the diagram type indicated above. If nothing is selected, then this will be interpreted as \"no restriction\", and the diagram will be visible to everyone.''\n# Save your settings. \n# Searches can be set up after saving. This allows you to define which search options should be available to users alongside the diagram:\n#* To do this, click on [[File:Edit.GIF]] and activate the desired searches. \n#* Save your settings.\n\nAfter the next login, the diagram will be visible in the view that you specified for \"Diagram type\". (In the example, the diagram is displayed under \"Diagrams about the employee\".)\n\n==Integrate diagram using a URL==\n\nEach diagram is accessed through a specific URL. There are Flash diagrams and HTML versions of diagrams.\n\nUse the following example steps to integrate diagrams using URLs:\n\n# As an [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|administrator]], go to the home page (or wherever you want to integrate a diagram) and click on [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] (-> click on CONFIGURE VIEW).\n# Click on the [[File:Config.gif]] after the title of the [[Containers|container]] that will contain the diagram.\n# Save the title there (under the original content name of the frame) and highlight in the “Original content '''URL''' for Iframe” section the URL to retrieve the diagram — e.g. (Haufe Employee Management) the URL of the HTML diagram with the ID 72:<br> /Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/[SwitchPeriodID]/[LangID]/[SelfID]/FromDasboard/'''72'''?get_xml=true&result_as_html=true <br> You can find a diagram's unique ID in the overview table of all diagram templates, or in the URL in the input field when you click on a template, e.g.: recruitingapp-xyz.umantis.com/DashBoards/'''65'''/Profile.\n# After you leave configuration mode, the diagram will be displayed in the Iframe.\n\n'''Use the following URLs to integrate HTML diagrams:'''\n* Example Haufe Employee Management: /Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/[SwitchPeriodID]/[LangID]/[SelfID]/FromDasboard/'''XX'''?get_xml=true&result_as_html=true\n* Example Haufe Applicant Management: \n:* /DashboardCF/'''XX'''/[LangID] \n:* /Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/1/[LangID]/[SelfID]/FromDasboard/'''XX'''?get_xml=true&result_as_html=true\n\n[[File:info.gif]] In the above examples, in each case it concerns a HTML diagram with a pseudo ID '''XX'''. This ID should be replaced with the correct ID of the desired diagram. The integrated URL is parsed when requested, and the variables are replaced.\n\n'''Explanation of URL parameters:'''<br>\nThe numbers in the links must be replaced by the corresponding diagram IDs. The variables [LangID] etc. are replaced by the system, so they can dynamically show different content to different viewers. The diagram can access these 3 parameters via [UrlID1], [UrlID2], [UrlID3] and then integrate them into the SQL. If variables are not used in the URL, however, ID wildcards must be used. Any integer number is possible here e.g. 1. ( /css/dashboard.html?xmlpath=/Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/1/1/1/FromDasboard9/123)\n\n==Special diagram templates==\n\n===Smart Org Chart===\nThe Smart Org Chart shows how the employee fits into his or her team, and can be integrated into any container in the employee profile. It shows the immediate supervisor, colleagues under the same immediate supervisor, and direct subordinates.\n \n''Integration in employee file'':\n\n/Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/[UrlID1]/2/[LangID]/FromDasboard9/98?get_xml=true&result_as_html=true\n\n* UrlID1 = the employee’s ID\n* UrlID2 = parameter to control whether colleagues should go under the same manager (1 no, 2 yes)\n* UrlID3 = [LangID] (Language)\n\nThe height of the Iframe should be set to at least \"800px\" and scroll behavior set to “auto”.\n\n==Developing SQL queries==\n[[Media:Variablen_MM.xlsx‎|Convert MM variables to SQL]]<br>\n[[Media:Variablen BM.xlsx|Convert BM variables to SQL]]\n\nGo to this URL (https://employeeapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Path2SQL or https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Path2SQL) and choose in advance the variables whose data you would like to use in an Excel report template SQL, a report template or a diagram template. \nYou can find variables very quickly by activating the [[Variables#How do you find the right variable for the right field?|variable finder]]. You can also easily search for variables in the (Excel) list, since the name is often self-explanatory — although it only exists in German and English versions. Once you have the variables, you can generate the corresponding Haufe SQL and use it in a report. \n\nThis approach to finding the data does not replace extensive knowledge of SQL. To create analytics, the snippets found for the database entries must be combined into a master SQL and aggregated until the desired report is completed.\n\n'''Sequence:'''\n#Find variable\n#Open Excel [[Media:Variablen_in_SQL_umwandeln.xlsx|Variablen in SQL umwandeln]]\n#Select Excel tab for the right application\n#Find variable\n#Enter path next to the variable here (URL /Path2SQL)\n#Use the SQL generated for the field in the analytics SQL (requires strong SQL skills)\n\n==Examples of diagrams/dashboards==\nBelow are some example diagrams/dashboards with step-by-step instructions for integration in Haufe.\n\n===MyTeam===\nAs a [[User roles in the employee management system#User roles|manager]], this dashboard in Employee Management provides you with a centralized overview of your employees and the status of each of their employee review meetings. From here, you can jump directly to the content of individual employee review meetings and take action on them. \n\n[[File:MyTeam_EN.png|600px|border]]\n\n====Integration in Haufe====\nIntegration in Haufe is handled by an [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|administrator]]. Please note that due to his/her role, the administrator cannot view any content after integrating the dashboard. \n\nAs administrator, you must take the following steps to integrate the dashboard: \n\n1. Find an appropriate place for the dashboard (e.g. on the [[Employee Management home page|home page]]).<br>\n2. Enter configuration mode.<br>\n3. Navigate to the desired/free container.<br>\n4. Show container if necessary [[File:Cwcvisibleon.gif]] and click on [[File:Config.gif]] .<br>\n5. Configure the settings in the container as per the following instructions:<br>\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''Container settings (configuration mode):''' \n[[File:Container_EN.png|350px|border]]      \n|\n# For “Original content name for Iframe”, enter a name/title in the desired “language fields”, e.g. “MyTeam”.\n# In the section “Original content URL for Iframe”, copy the following URL into the desired \"language fields\": <br> '''/cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''<br>'''Optional:''' <br>If you want to hide certain content on the dashboard, add the respective URL-extension as well:\n#* To hide '''performance/Goals''':\n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&Objectives=0'''\n#* To hide '''tasks''':\n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&WorkTasks=0'''\n#* To hide '''development goals''':\n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&DevelopObj=0'''\n#* To hide '''conduct''': \n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&Behavior=0'''\n#* To hide '''feedback''': \n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&Feedback=0'''\n#* To hide '''potential'''\n#: /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&Potential=0'''<br>\n#: [[File:info.gif]] '''Show original labels instead of stars''':\n#: Insert the following URL extension to show the original labels in the dashboard, rather than stars:<br> /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&originalRating=true'''  \n#: [[File:info.gif]] To hide '''employee photos''':\n#: Insert the following URL extension to hide employee photos in the dashboard:<br> /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&noPictures=true'''\n#: [[File:info.gif]] '''Show only text (comment on assessment) instead of stars''':\n#: Insert the following URL extension for the relevant employee review meeting content to hide stars and instead display only text (comments on the assessment):<br> /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&WorkTasks=text'''\n#: Insert the following URL extension to activate the \"Confirm agreement\" option for managers:<br> /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&confirmAgreement=1'''\n#: Insert the following URL extension to activate the \"Confirm assessment\" option for managers:<br> /cheetah/epm/myteam/index.html#?SwitchPeriodID=[SwitchPeriodID]'''&confirmRating=1'''\n# Put a checkmark in the box for “[[Containers#Calculate height automatically|Automatically calculate height]]”. Finally, click Save. \n|-\n|}\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that the contents of the “MyTeam” dashboard will only be displayed if you have employees, or have employees assigned to you as their responsible [[User roles in the employee management system#User roles|manager]], and are logged in to the system accordingly with that role. If you have done this but still do not see any content displayed, [[Emptying the browser cache|please clear your browser cache]].\n\n===Employee dashboard (birthdays, new employees, anniversaries)===\n\nDepending on the integration and configuration in use, this dashboard can display various information in Employee Management:\n\n'''Upcoming employee birthdays''' <br>\n\n[[File:Birthdays.png|600px|border]] \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Employees’ and colleagues’ upcoming birthdays are displayed. The ''/SelfService''view is a good place to integrate this.\n\n'''Other variations:'''\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:700px\"> '''New employees'''  (Click on “Expand”) <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n[[File:Latest_Hirings.png|600px|border]] <br>\nNew employees are displayed.

The dashboard shows employees for whom the following anniversaries are coming up: one, two and five-year anniversaries, as well as all later anniversaries in 5-year increments (i.e. 10, 15, 20 years, etc.). This dashboard can be integrated anywhere that you want to display upcoming anniversaries to users. \n</div></div>\n\n* '''New internally filled jobs''' \n: The most recent internally-filled jobs are displayed. The ''/SelfService''view is a good place to integrate this.\n\n====Integration and configuration====\n# Navigate to the appropriate container and/or follow the instructions up to Step 5 [[#Integration in Haufe|as described above]]. \n# In configuration mode, enter one of the following URLs (depending on which information you wish to display) in the '''''Original content Iframe URL''''' section, unless it is already listed there. <br>'''To display:'''\n#* '''upcoming/next birthdays:''' /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view='''upcomingBirthdays''' \n#* '''new, internal appointments:''' /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view='''changedPosition'''\n#* '''new employees:''' /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view='''latestHirings'''\n#* '''forthcoming anniversaries:''' /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view='''nextJubilees''' \n# Save.\n\n=====Additional configuration options=====\n[[File:attention.gif]] The following configuration options are shown as an example on the dashboard “'''Upcoming employee birthdays'''” dashboard (''upcomingBirthdays'').

With this filter, the dashboard (e.g. in the ''/SelfService'' view) shows an employee all of their colleagues in the relevant organizational units. The parent organizational unit (= one level above the employee’s OrgUnit) and all organizational units belonging to this organizational unit (the levels below it) are displayed here as well.\nIf no filter is set, the dashboard will display all of the company’s employees. Take note here of the notes in the section below on “''Specifying number of content items loaded''” as well.\n| Add the following URL extension to filter contents by organizational units: '''&filterBy=orgUnit'''\n| /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view=upcomingBirthdays&filterBy=orgUnit\n|-\n|'''Show contents filtered by access permissions'''\n| [[File:info.gif]] When you set this filter, dashboard users can only see the colleagues/employees to whom they have access (based on their [[User roles in the employee management system|access permissions/role assignments]]). \nIf no filter is set, the dashboard will display all of the company’s employees. Take note here of the notes in the section below on “''Specifying number of content items loaded''” as well.\n| Add the following URL extension to filter contents by access permissions: '''&filterBy=accessRights'''\n| /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view=upcomingBirthdays&filterBy=accessRights\n|-\n| '''Hide employee photos'''\n| This configuration option can be useful if you do not want to use or display employee photos.\n| Add the following URL extension to hide employee photos in a given dashboard: '''&noPictures''' \n| /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view=upcomingBirthdays&noPictures\n|-\n| '''Remove links'''\n| Using this configuration option removes links from the displayed content items. \n| Add the following URL extension to remove links from the displayed content items: '''&noLinking''' \n| /cheetah/epm/people-filter/#?view=upcomingBirthdays&noLinking\n|-\n| '''Specify number of content items loaded'''\n| Using this configuration option allows you to define a specific limit on the maximum number of records to be loaded. \n[[File:Info.gif]]  By default, 24 records are loaded.

Note that the following status IDs are automatically excluded from the dashboard by default: \n* ID: 2170 (''Declined'')\n* ID: 2180 (''Hired'')\n* ID: 2190 (''Application withdrawn'')\n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80'''<nowiki>&excludeStatusIDs=2060|2080|2070</nowiki>'''\n|-\n|'''No contact since'''\n| This configuration option can be useful if you want to mark applicants with whom you have not been in contact for a specified number of days. \n| Enter the following URL extension to display an email icon next to the applicant if you have not been in contact for 7 days: “'''&noContactSince=7'''”\nIf you would like to display an email icon if there has been no contact with the candidate for more than a specified number of days, add the “&noContactSince=” extension:\n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80'''&noContactSince=7'''\n|-\n| '''Star marking for exceptional top candidates'''\n| This configuration option can be useful if you want especially good applicants to be specially highlighted.\n| Enter the following URL extension to mark the exceptional top candidates with a star: \"'''&highlightAtPct=95'''\". In this example, stars are used to mark “exceptional” top candidates who have a 95% match or better with the selection criteria. Of course, you can also use other values for “&highlightAtPct”. However, it is recommended that you always set this value higher than the one in “minScorePct”. Use whole numbers between 1 and 100.\n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80'''&highlightAtPct=95'''\n|-\n| '''Hide photos'''\n| This configuration option can be useful if you do not want to display applicant photos.\n| Add the following URL extension to hide applicant photos in a given dashboard: '''&noPictures''' \n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80'''&noPictures'''\n|-\n| '''Specify number of content items loaded'''\n| Using this configuration option allows you to define a specific limit on the maximum number of records to be loaded. \n[[File:Info.gif]]  By default, 24 records are loaded. You can use various values for “&limit”, but note that only whole numbers between 1 and 9999 may be used.\n| Add the following URL extension to limit the number of records loaded to 10: '''&limit=''10''''' \n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80&noContactSince=7&highlightAtPct=95'''&limit=10'''\n|-\n| '''Specify number of content items displayed per page'''\n| Using this configuration option allows you to define a specific limit on the number of content items to be displayed on the first page. \n[[File:Info.gif]] By default, 12 records are shown on each page. The user can navigate to Page 2 to view 12 more records. You can use various values for “&pageSize”, but note that only whole numbers between 1 and 9999 may be used. \n| Add the following URL extension to limit the number of records displayed on each page to 5: '''&pageSize=''5''''' \n| /cheetah/recruiting/top-applicants/index.html#?minScorePct=80'''&pageSize=5'''\n|}\n</div></div>\n\n<br>\n\n==Customizing diagrams==\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note on customizing diagrams:''' <br>\n: Note that when default diagrams are modified, updates to improve these diagrams can no longer be applied. '''Our tip:''' first copy the diagrams to a new diagram template and don’t customize the default diagrams; this allows you to benefit from updates.\n\n===Source of applications===\n'''Sequence:'''\n#Go to the diagram template view under Analytics > diagram templates (/DashBoards)\n#Open the diagrams to be modified (by default these are no. 51 and no. 52)\n#Save the attached XML file on your local computer\n#Find the line “chart = new Highcharts.Chart ({” and add the following line under that one, including a comma at the end: colors: ['#4572A7', '#AA4643', '#89A54E', '#80699B', '#3D96AE','#DB843D', '#92A8CD', '#A47D7C', '#B5CA92'] \n#Add more colors as needed for the number of selection list values\n#Save the XML again\n#Now replace the XML file in the system with your newly customized XML file\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Reports|Reports]]\n* [[Analyses|Analytics]]\n* [[Diagram template details|Diagram template details]]\n* [[Diagrams about people|Diagrams about people]]\n* [[Diagrams about the employee|Diagrams about the employee]]\n* [[Diagrams about the employee review meeting|Diagrams about the employee review meeting]]\n* [[Diagrams about events|Diagrams about events]]\n* [[Certificates|Certificates]]"

In [[Employee management|Employee Management]], they are used both in the [[Events|Events]] area to record the participants’ preferences and knowledge and to gather feedback after the event, and in the [[Jobs (employee management)|Jobs]] area.\n\nThere are three types of questions (identical in Employee Management and Applicant Management):\n\n* Questions with only a free text field (free text answer)\n* Questions for which at most one of the provided answers may be selected (pre-defined, simple, with text)\n* Questions for which none, one or several of the provided answers may be selected (pre-defined, multiple, with text)\n\nClick on the links labeled “More information” or “Help on this question type” to see various examples of all three question and answer types.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that due to caching, changes to dynamic questions may take a little while to appear (up to 15 minutes).\n==Create new question==\n'''Applicant Management'''\n* To create a question, click the “Create new question” link on the “Selection criteria” tab. \n* This opens a window in which you can word the question, specify its position in the display, and enter the answers. \n* If you do not choose the free text answer, you can award points to the different answers. For example, the answer that you would ideally expect will be given 10 points, the others 6, 3 or 1, or no points at all. \n* You may also include so-called “knockout questions” for applicants. If applicants fail to select an answer, or select an answer that is awarded 0 points, that person’s application is marked as “Knocked out” in the “Questions” column (overview of all applications). \n* You can mark questions as “Must be answered” (tip: use these mandatory questions sparingly). These questions need to be answered before the application process can continue. \n* Under “'''Maximum possible point score'''”, you can define the maximum score that can be achieved. This value is then shown in the overview even if an applicant actually achieved a higher score. \n: [[File:info.gif]] Even if you do not specify any value for “Maximum possible point score” when creating a new question, the maximum possible point score for each question will be listed in the overview (''[[HR evaluation|HR assessment]]''), along with the actual point score and the resulting percentage value. \n: '''Example:'''  \n:* ''Point score, question catalog (total): 25''\n:* ''Maximum point score, question catalog (total): 45''\n:* ''Point score as a percentage (total): 56%''\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] In Applicant Management, the box for “Don’t show in question catalog” is checked by default. Uncheck it if you want the question to be included in the question catalog for later use.\n\nOnce you have finished defining all questions and answers, and assigned points to them, click “Add”.\n\n==Where are dynamic questions used in [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]]?==\n===Selection questions for applicants===\nYou can define additional questions for the applicants in order to create the best possible conditions for a preliminary selection. Applicants answer these questions when they submit their applications online. To define such questions for the applicants, you must select the relevant job in the [[Vacancies (applicant management)|Job Overview]]. Selecting a job will take you to the [[Job profile (applicant management)|Job profile]]. The page for creating questions is found under [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]. You also have the option to create a new question (see above), or to re-use existing questions from the [[Question catalog|question catalog]] for your job.\nIf an applicant has skipped the questions by clicking “Cancel”, you can email them a reminder to answer those questions by clicking the “Make questions available to be answered and send email” link in the “HR assessment” tab. This action releases the questions for this job to the applicant a second time.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Tip:''' To point the applicant directly to his profile (and the questions), use the following link in the relevant email template: ''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService/MyProfile'' \n: '''Recommendation:''' Include a note in the e-mail that the questions can be answered via \"My profile\" in the specific application.\n\n[[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:BM Webseminar August 09-6.swf|Extract from webinar on questions for applicants (11 mins)]]\n\n===EEOC Questions===\n[[File:GDPR.png|50px]] <br>\n“[http://www.eeoc.gov/ EEOC] questions” are questions about the topic of equal opportunity in employment. They are relevant for application processes in the United States. This function '''complies with applicable law in the United States''' aimed at guaranteeing equal opportunity in employment. (More information: http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/hiring/affirmativeact.htm).<br>\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] ''The EEOC questions are ONLY relevant for branch offices in the United States, where they are required by law. If you activate the EEOC questions for branch offices outside the United States, please ensure that collecting this information does not violate local data privacy laws.''\n\nThis note is also found in the [[Branches#Application process and Application process configuration|Application process configuration]] section for each [[Branches|branch office]] (''Settings > Branch offices > Select branch office > Settings tab > Application process configuration''). <br>Please take note of the information on the following page: [[Information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|Information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]\n\n* '''Activate EEOC questions (U.S. only):'''\n: To use EEOC questions in the application form, navigate to: \n: ''Settings > Branch offices > Select branch > Settings tab > Application process configuration > Click on [[File:edit.GIF]]'' \n: Check the box in the “EEOC questions” section. The questions are then included on the application form. The answers to these questions are not displayed for the respective applicant (in the application documents). They can only be viewed by personnel managers via a report that shows an evaluation about the distribution (e.g. gender, ethnicity, impairments etc.). <br> [[File:info.gif]] Export variables: [Applicant.EEOCGender], [Applicant.EEOCEthnicity], [Applicant.EEOCVeteran], [Applicant.EEOCDisability]\n\n===Internal list of criteria for an application===\nA criteria list can be stored for each job profile. Contrary to the applicant questions, this list is intended for internal use only and will not be displayed externally. There are three types of questions and answers. Clicking the “Create new question link” calls up a window in which you can enter questions for the applicants. If you provide a choice of answers, you can award a points score to each of the answers. After the interview with the applicant, this leads to a points total which can easily be compared with that of other applicants.\n\nFinally, click Save. The question you just created is listed in a tabular view in the “Questions” tab.\n\n==Where are dynamic questions used in [[Employee management|Employee Management]]?==\n===Events===\n[[File:Info.gif]] For [[Events|events]] and also within a job, under the criteria for internal selection, you do '''not''' have the option to make answering the questions mandatory. The results are visible in the “Analytics” tab for each event.\n\n====Registration questions for an event====\nTo achieve the best possible preparation for an event, you have the option of defining registration questions for the participants. Participants answer these questions when they participate in the event. To define such questions, navigate to the event’s [[Publish an event|Publication]] area.\n\n====Evaluation for an event====\nFor events, you can create evaluation questions both for the participants and for speakers. The participants answer these questions when the event is over. To define such questions, navigate to [[Publish an event|Creating the event]], then to the [[Publish an event|Publication]] area, and enter the details there.\n\nEvaluation questions can be copied from a predefined question catalog, which can be entered under [[Settings|Settings]] in the Events tab. Select the “Copy evaluation questions from the catalog” action right in the [[Publish an event|event posting]].\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Tip:''' If you want to send the participants an [[Email|email]] containing a link to the first evaluation question for the event, you can use the following link in the template: ''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService/MyParticipations/Profile/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/[IF Event.MaxParticipantNumber][Event.MaxParticipantNumber][ELSE]9000[END]/PostQuestions/NextTargetID?resetAnswering=true'' \n<br>In order for this link to work correctly, the questions must first be copied to the registration. <br>\n\nIf you want to include the copying in the link, you can do this via the following link: \n#for employees:         ''https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService/MyParticipations/Profile/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/[IF Event.MaxParticipantNumber][Event.MaxParticipantNumber][ELSE]9000[END]/PersID/[Person.ID]/CopySurvey2'' \n#for external participants:  ''https://[Special.Hostname]/Public/ExternalParticipants/Profile/Participation/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/[IF Event.MaxParticipantNumber][Event.MaxParticipantNumber][ELSE]9000[END]/PersID/[Person.ID]/CopySurvey2''\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Important information for customers that have integrated the following link in templates:'''\n<nowiki>https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService/MyParticipations/Profile/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/PersID/ID/CopySurvey2</nowiki> \n: Please that this outdated link redirects to an error page. Replace this link with the new link that includes the copying (see above).\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Tip:''' The following IF query can be used to send an email asking employees and external individuals to answer the evaluation questions:<br>\n[IF Person.Typ == 'Mitarbeiter']https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService/MyParticipations/Profile/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/[IF Event.MaxParticipantNumber][Event.MaxParticipantNumber][ELSE]9000[END]/PersID/[Person.ID]/CopySurvey2[ELSE]https://[Special.Hostname]/Public/ExternalParticipants/Profile/Participation/[Teilnahme.ID]/GeneralData/[IF Event.MaxParticipantNumber][Event.MaxParticipantNumber][ELSE]9000[END]/PersID/[Person.ID]/CopySurvey2[END]\n----\n\n===Jobs area — Internal job postings===\n[[Vacancy notice (employee management)|Internal applications in Employee Management]] operate on a practically identical principle to those in Applicant Management. \n\n==Actions==\n* In Employee Management for events, and in Applicant Management: [[Question catalog|Copy questions from catalog]]\n* In Employee Management for the Jobs function:\n*** View job posting preview\n*** [[Function profiles|Assign function profile]]\n*** Historize job\n*** Reactivate archived job\n*** Delete job\n*** Create reminder for job\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[Vacancy notice (applicant management)|Publish job (Applicant Management)]]<br />\n*[[Vacancy notice (employee management)|Publish job (Employee Management)]]<br />\n*[[Publish an event|Publish an event]]<br />"

The cause of the error can be analyzed based on the error number.\nThe most common errors involve the following codes:\n\n* '''Error 401:''' ''Website could not be loaded'': The request cannot be completed without valid authentication.\n* '''Error 403:''' ''No permissions'': You do not have permission to access this page.\n* '''Error 404:''' ''The requested page does not exist'': The requested resource was not found, i.e. the link as entered is either incorrect or outdated.\n* '''Error 500:''' ''Internal Server Error'': An unexpected server error has occurred.\n* '''Error 503:''' ''Service Unavailable'': Server temporarily unavailable, overloaded, down or undergoing maintenance.\n:Actions that may help to resolve errors:\n:* Log out of the Umantis solution and log back in again\n:* Check the URL in the address bar for typos\n:* Go back to the previous page and perform the action again\n:* Check access permissions\n:[[File:Info.gif]] To learn more about how to set up your pages for errors 403 or 404, see [[External appearance#Your 404-page|External appearance]]\n\n* '''Error message:''' '''''Form was not saved because the security token was not sent.'''''\n: '''Cause:''' This error message is due to a security issue, e.g. if a user attempts to submit a form multiple times or upload a document to the same place multiple times. The security feature is intended to prevent attacks via form submissions, and is considered as valid behavior.  \n: '''Possible solutions:''' \n:* This error is often caused by outdated cookies in the user's browser.

Selecting an Excel report template in the overview will take you to the [[Excel report template details|Excel report template details]].\n\nWith Excel report templates, you can use an SQL query to save the data you want to an HTML file, and then make that file available for further processing in Excel. Since selecting the right data requires in-depth knowledge of our data structures, only system administrators and (in Employee Management) users with the “Analysis” role have access to the analytics pages. \nYou specify which data and fields should appear in the individual reports. The actual SQL queries are usually prepared for you by a Haufe employee.\n \nIn the table, you will find five columns with symbols at the right.\nIn the first column [[File:Document.gif‎]], you can view the current data extract from the report.\nClicking on the [[File:Filetype_Excel.gif‎]] icon in the second column displays the existing Excel analytics for your report. You can edit or delete them there.\nClicking on the [[File:Action.gif‎]] icon in the third column starts the SQL query for this report, and you can see in the fifth column whether the query was valid.\nThe [[File:Archive.gif]] symbol in the fourth column leads to this report’s history.\n \nIf you want to update a previously created Excel file without waiting for the specified interval, you can use the symbol to select the report you want, then click on the name of the Excel file to open the file. Click in a filled-out field in the Excel file to activate it. Then go to Data and select Refresh data. This will display the most recent data in the specified form.\n \nIf you want the data to be refreshed automatically when the file is opened, go to “Data range properties” under Data — External data. In the “External data range properties” window, check the box for “Refresh data on file open”.\n\n==Technical notes==\n* The individual Excel report templates are stored as CronJobs which are executed at specific intervals. As part of each CronJob’s execution, the SQL query is run and the result is stored in a new HTML file in the database. The HTML is only created when the report is saved after the SQL query runs without error. \n* The file can also be created manually via the [[File:Action.gif]] symbol. This HTML file is then accessed by the query stored in the Excel file that was originally configured by Haufe, and updates the data contained in the existing Excel report template. \n* To prevent certain types of errors and misuse through the execution of SQL statements, the statement is filtered and blocked if certain syntax is found.<br> Commands like ALTER, DELETE, INSERT etc. cannot be executed. \n* In addition, the [[User roles in the employee management system#Analytics (dashboards and ad-hocs)|“Analytics” module role]] must be assigned to at least one user on the customer’s side, since a user login must be specified for the call from inside the Excel file. The login information can either be hardcoded into the web request, or you can require that it be re-entered every time the Excel data are updated.\n\n\n'''Note:'''\nIf an SQL error occurs while your report is running (this also applies to [[Diagrams / Dashboards / Charts|diagrams]] and [[Automatic exports|automatic exports]]), you must first correct the SQL and save it again, since the saved error prevents it from being executed again. Diagrams are an exception to this, as they are not subsequently blocked.\n\n==Security of your data==\nNote that your data are password-protected, and no one without access to the solution (i.e. a login) can view the data. <br>\nHowever, Excel report templates are '''NOT''' appropriate for use in analyzing sensitive data. Any employee can call up this report. It is not possible to limit access to the data to people with particular roles or access settings.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] There is a '''secure alternative''', however: report templates ([[Reports|Analytics]] > Report templates). \n\nAs a workaround, Excel sheets can also read data that can be provided via diagrams. In this case, Haufe login-specific data can be prepared and entered in Excel. The templates for these reports can of course be saved with the Excel report templates. '''Make sure that you save the templates with no data in them, however.''' We cannot control data security if Excel files containing data are shared with other people. When in doubt, contact our [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com Customer Service] team for answers and support.\n\n==Automatically refresh data in Excel==\nOne key factor here is the structure of the .iqy file that controls how connections are established from Excel to the Haufe web solution. The correct structure and sequence of parameters for Applicant Management and Employee Management are listed below. All you need to modify are: \n* Your customer ID\n* The ID of the Excel checklist template\n* Your username and password\nIMPORTANT: Never save the data as “UTF-8 with BOM” (often referred to as simply “UTF-8”); if you do, Excel will not be able to process the file. The Windows-standard ANSI format is sufficient.\n\nYou can download an example file here: [[Media:Report.iqy|Example Excel report templates]]\n===Web query in Applicant Management (Stable) through 12/17/2012===\nWEB<br>\n1<br>\n<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''CUSTOMERID'''.umantis.com/Administration/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File<br>\nep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File&UserName=[\"USERNAME\"]&PassWord=[\"PASSWORD\"]&Login=true&URLFrom=/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File\n\nsave as webquery.iqy\n\n===Web query in Applicant Management===\nWEB<br>\n1<br>\n<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''CUSTOMERID'''.umantis.com/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File<br>\nep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File&UserName=[\"USERNAME\"]&PassWord=[\"PASSWORD\"]&Login=true&URLFrom=/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File\n\n===Web query in Employee Management===\nWEB<br>\n1<br>\n<nowiki>https://employeeapp-</nowiki>'''CUSTOMERID'''.umantis.com/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File<br>\nep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File&UserName=[\"USERNAME\"]&PassWord=[\"PASSWORD\"]&Login=true&URLFrom=/Adhoc/'''ID'''/html/ShowDocument/show.html?ep=/CronJobs/'''ID'''/Runs/PtrActualRun/File\n\n\nsave as webquery.iqy\n\n==Open Excel file==\n# Data => Connections\n# Click “Add” button\n# Click “Browse for More...” button and add .iqy file\n# Once the iqy has been added, click “Properties” in the window that is already open, then activate “Refresh on file open”\n# Place the cursor at the location in the Excel file where you want to insert the query data\n# Data => Open Existing Connections\n# Double-click on the name - displayed with [Empty] - of the connection file in the window that appears\n# Specify the cell (by default where the cursor is), username and password \n# Load data\nCAUTION: To refresh the data, always close Excel and then reopen it.\n\n==Allow comment fields for Excel import==\nTo allow multi-line comment fields from Haufe to Excel in a single field, you can do the following:\n<br>\n<nowiki>'=CONCATENATE(\"' || REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(\"Title\".\"Comments\",'\"',E''''),'.','.\";\"'),E'\\n','\";CHAR(10);\"') || '\";)' AS \"Goal of the action\",</nowiki>\n\n* Replace \\n with CHAR(10) => break into lines\n* Replace . with “;” => so that the maximum length of 255 is not exceeded when concatenating (long texts without \\n cause problems otherwise)\n* Replace \" with ‘ => causes problems with the concatenation formula otherwise\n* To display everything correctly, the field must be recognized as a formula, which is why we use =CONCATENATE(\"....\";CHAR(10);\"....\")\n\n==Important note==\nAnalytics on Excel report templates do not react to restrictions on permissions for individual users of the data, because the raw data are pre-calculated overnight, and it is not possible to know at that time who might want to retrieve those data the following day. \nIf you want to read permissions-specific analytics into Excel, you can use a diagram template as a data source and use the diagram to generate HTML output that contains only the data that the person logging in has permission to view. In some versions, however, Excels show a behavior in which it remembers the first successful login on the computer, and then sends the old successful login information after the next login attempt. The result is that the same data are always delivered, because Haufe receives the login information for the FIRST login again, and then (correctly) sends the data associated with that login.\n\n'''Example web query in Employee Management via diagram template (requires special XSLT)'''\nWEB<br>\n1<br>\n<nowiki>https://employeeapp-</nowiki>'''CUSTOMERID'''.umantis.com/Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/1/1/1/FromDasboard9/'''DiagramID'''?get_xml=true&result_as_html=1<br>\nep=/Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/1/1/1/FromDasboard9/'''DiagramID'''&UserName=[\"Username\"]&PassWord=[\"Password\"]&Login=true&URLFrom=/Administration/ShowDashboardWithIDs/1/1/1/FromDasboard9/'''DiagramID'''&get_xml=true&result_as_html=1\n\nsave as webquery.iqy... the IDs 1/1/1 can also be submitted as special SQL control IDs, and might contain e.g. the desired period.\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Create new Excel report template|Create new Excel report template]]"

In the original form, all export templates are also valid for [[Imports|reimporting]] the data. Images such as company logos cannot be used in the export templates.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] There are restrictions for Excel export templates (multiple actions and exporting selected entries to Excel). Formatting in empty cells is completely ignored. To keep the formatting, you must therefore insert at least one space character in the cell. When images are inserted, the entire template sometimes fails to work correctly. \nPivot tables are also lost. This variant is only suitable for pure raw data with no analytics. If entries are inserted into other worksheets, the template will no longer work. \n\nMacros, pivot tables and all types of formatting are allowed for report templates with SQL queries. No limitations are currently known.\n\n==Create and edit export template==\nIf you want to design your own template, you can create, edit and upload it in Excel.

For example, a job market or a public events catalog is often customized to match the design of the company's homepage. There follows a description of how to do these customizations and what you particularly need to look out for when doing them.\n\nHere you will find all the links for [[Integrating applicant management|Integrating applicant management]] and [[Integrating employee management|Integrating employee management]].\n\n==Integration type==\n\n[[Integrating applicant management|You can design external pages in Applicant management]], such as, for example, the job market, or external sites in employee management, such as, e.g. an events catalog, as your own complete page and link from your homepage to this page. However, you can also incorporate the relevant pages of Umantisvia an iFrame in your homepage.\n\n===Microsite===\n\nThe microsite is an independent site that is opened in a separate browser window. You can link to the relevant pages on your homepage. In case of a \"microsite\", the entire site is with Umantis. Umantisopens in a pop-up window and has the entire page area available (except for the title row, which you can configure as you wish in Umantis). You can customize the header, footer and banner in your solution, and also incorporate your company logo into it.\n\n===iFrame===\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note that an integration of '''pop-ups within an iframe''' should be completely avoided, or are even '''not supported'''. Some browser providers (e.g. Apple) do not allow / do not support this constellation. In addition, this type of integration is also not recommended for usability reasons.\n\nIf you integrate Umantis Applicant management into your website using the so-called iFrame (inline frame), you should leave out the header, footer and banner. With an iFrame integration, the navigation, title row and footer (sky blue areas) are up to you (homepage). In the content area you integrate the Umantis solution in a frame.\n\nSince with this type of integration, the pure Umantis pages tend to look very \"bare\". Therefore, you generally should not have any links directly to the Umantis pages. Hence, you should configure all the links in your [[Templates#Email templates|e-mail templates]] and [[System e-mails|system e-mails]] so that they point to the appropriate page of your homepage. \n\n====Configuring the iFrame for correct scrolling====\n\nTo ensure that while navigating through the Umantis solution, your website scrolls up automatically, you need to configure your website a little more. With iFrame that you are using to integrate the Umantis solution, the attribute '''onLoad=\"self.scrollTo(0,0)\"''' also needs to be set. In the context, it should then look roughly like this:\n\n&lt;iframe src=\"https://recruitingapp-123.umantis.com/Jobs/1\" width=\"123\" height=\"123\" name=\"myIframe\" '''onLoad=\"self.scrollTo(0,0)\"'''&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n====Automatic height adjustment of the iFrame====\n\nSo that the height of the iFrame on your website adjusts dynamically to the height of the Umantis solution, a few adjustments to your website are required. Some Javascript experience is required and the following points should ideally be carried out by your appointed website administrator or web designer.\n\n* Your website must have [http://jquery.com/download/ jQuery] embedded, ideally the '''latest version'''. Depending on which jQuery version is used, please note the following points:\n:* For jQuery versions >= 1.9 and <= 3.0, the official [https://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin jQuery Migrate plugin] must also be included.\n:* For jQuery versions >= 2.0, the [https://plugins.jquery.com/browser/ jQuery Browser plugin] must also be included.\n*  Next, an additional script is required on your website. Visit https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-postmessage to retrieve the [https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-postmessage/master/jquery.ba-postmessage.js jquery.ba-postmessage.js]- script and integrate it into the header area of your site e.g. <code><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery.ba-postmessage.js\"></script></code>.\n*  The following script should likewise appear in the header area.\n\n <nowiki>\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n\t$(document).ready(function() {\n\t\tvar if_height, src = 'https://recruitingapp-xxxx.umantis.com/Vacancies',\n\t\tiframe = $( '&lt;iframe src=\"' + src + '\" name=\"' + document.location.href + '\" width=\"980\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"&gt;&lt;\\/iframe&gt;' ).appendTo( '#umantis_iframe' );\n\n\t\t$.receiveMessage(function(e){\n\n\t\t\tvar h = Number(e.data.replace(/[^0-9\\.]+/g,\"\"));\n\n\t\t\tif (!isNaN( h ) && h &gt; 0 && h&nbsp;!== if_height) {\n\t\t\t\t/* Height has changed, update the iframe */\n\t\t\t\tif_height = h;\n\t\t\t\tiframe.height(h);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} );\n\t});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</nowiki>\nWhere on the fourth line the https://recruitingapp-xxxx.umantis.com/Vacancies should be replaced by your desired target page, which is then loaded in the iframe. In addition, you can specify at <code>width=\"980\"</code> and / or <code>height=\"500\"</code> your desired mass of the iframe, where the value for ''height'' is rather incidental, since this will ultimately always dynamically adapt to the height of the Umantis solution.\n* In the body area, instead of your own iframe <nowiki><iframe src=\"...\"></iframe></nowiki> you have to use the following DIV element (the script from above finally places an iframe in this div): <code><nowiki><div id=\"umantis_iframe\"></div></nowiki></code>.\n* Finally, in the design settings of your Umantis solution, the following CSS must be inserted in the General CSS field: <code>div#wrapper { min-height: 0; }</code>.\n\nThe next steps are only necessary if you use ad templates to which the iframe of your website should also dynamically adapt:\n* Include [http://jquery.com/download/ jQuery] as well as the [https://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin jQuery Migrate plugin] and/or the [https://plugins.jquery.com/browser/ jQuery Browser plugin] in the HTML files of the ad templates as before.\n\n* Also jquery.ba-postmessage.js needs to be included again. The best way to include it is to upload the script as an attachment to the listing and access the script with <code><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[document.attachmentX]\"></script></code> (where X represents the unique number of the attachment).\n* Last but not least, the following script follows in the head section, where instead of <code>$('#container')</code> you need to specify the selector to the outermost (and thus probably potentially highest) HTML element in your ad. Often this is the body element <code>$('body')</code>:\n\n <nowiki>\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n\t$(document).ready(function() {\n\t\tvar parentiframe_autoresize = window&nbsp;!= window.parent;\t/* Check if current content is loaded in an iframe */\n\t\tif(parentiframe_autoresize) {\t\t/* If so, periodically send content-height to the parent-window/iframe */\n\t\t\tvar parent_url = window.name;\n\n\t\t\tfunction setCustomerHeight() {\n\t\t\t\t$.postMessage({ if_height: $('#container').height() }, parent_url, parent );\n\t\t\t};\n\t\t\tsetCustomerHeight();\n\t\t\tsetInterval(setCustomerHeight, 500);\n\t\t}\n\t});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</nowiki>\n\n====Responsive iFrames====\nIf the micro-site is responsive, the integration via iFrame should also be responsive. Depending on the integration or the CSS which is applied to the iFrame, accordingly also the \"total package\" is responsive. The iFrame has to have a relative width (e.g. width: 90%) or respond responsively via media-queries. The \"content\" of Umantis reacts in iFrame, just like the Umantis solution in the \"Browser\" window. With respect to responsiveness, the Umantis solution does not notice whether it is directly open in a browser window or in an iFrame. (EXCEPTION: For Dynamic iFrame height adjustment via javascript, see: [[#Automatic height adjustment of the iFrame (new interface only)|Automatic height adjustment of the iFrame (new user interface only)]].\n\n==Set up a design==\n===Configure the integration of Umantis===\n====Your header====\n\nHere you can upload an HTML file that appears at the top, above the entire Umantis solution. It is essential that this HTML file has the name \"header.html\", otherwise it will not display. You also need to specify the header height in pixels so that enough space is reserved for it. If you specify too little, only part of the header will appear, while if you specify too much, it may result in an unnecessarily large empty space.<br /> You can access a sample header here: [[Media:Umantis_onlinehelp_example_header.zip|Umantis_onlinehelp_example_header.zip]]\n\n<br />\n\n====Your footer====\n\nHere you can upload an HTML file that appears below the Umantis solution. It is essential that this HTML file has the name \"footer.html\", otherwise it will not display. You also need to specify the footer height in pixels so that enough space is reserved for it. If you specify too little, only part of the footer will appear, while if you specify too much, it may result in an unnecessarily large empty space.\n\n====Your 404-page====\n\nHere you can upload an HTML file that appears to those people who are on the Umantis web system but have called a page which does not exist. It is essential that this HTML file is called \"404.html\", otherwise it will not display. If you also want to add images to the error file, you need to upload them further down and access them via the \"/pubhtml\" directory in the \"404.html\". Assuming the image file is called \"fehlerbild.jpg\" you can insert the image into the \"404.html\" with \"&lt;img src=\"/pubhtml/fehlerbild.jpg\"&gt;\".\n\n'''Notes:'''\n*  If no further settings have been applied, the error page is always displayed in the \"German\" '''language''' by default. If the error page must also be supported in other languages, the pages must be placed into the corresponding pages and uploaded separately.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] New error pages: [[Media:403 404.zip|403_404.zip]]\n\n====Your 403-page====\n\nHere you can upload an HTML file that appears to those people who are on the Umantis web system but have called a page for which they have no permission. It is essential that this HTML file is called \"403.html\", otherwise it will not display. To insert images, you need to note the same as with the 404 page.\n\n'''Notes:'''\n*  If no further settings have been applied, the error page is always displayed in the \"German\" '''language''' by default. If the error page must also be supported in other languages, the pages must be placed into the corresponding pages and uploaded separately.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] New error pages: [[Media:403 404.zip|403_404.zip]]\n\n====Your label====\n\nA form in the Umantis solution is divided into two columns, with the left-hand side containing the labels or identifiers of the fields to be filled in on the right-hand side. Here with \"Your label\", you can change the width of the left-hand column, which is particularly useful if you want to integrate the Umantis solution in an iFrame and the form pages are too wide for your iframe. Please ensure that, when specifying the width, you only give the number in pixels without \"px\", that is e.g. if you want to set the width to 200 pixels, just enter \"200\" in the field and not \"200px\". If there is nothing in the field, the default width of 300 pixels is used.\n\n[[File:Design BreiteDerLabels DE.JPG|Design BreiteDerLabels DE.JPG]]\n\n<em>* Width of the label</em>\n\n====Files which can be linked in the header and/or the banner====\n\nHere you can upload files that can be linked to in the header, banner, footer and the external design. Note that a maximum of 10 files may be uploaded in each language.\n\n===Customize external design===\n====Basic design: Tables and tabs====\n\nCheck this box if you want to have the corners rounded on tables, tabs, search boxes and various content boxes.\n\n====General====\n\nHere very general items can be set up which impact on all or very many screens in the external design. For example the '''background colour for the Umantis banner''' can be specified (this is the area coloured in red in the screenshot further below). In doing this you can use any valid CSS color value formats. For example, the red in the sample screenshot can be specified in different formats; \"red\", \"#ff0000\" and \"rgb(255,0,0)\" (in each case with no inverted commas) all have the same result.\n\nThe '''font family''' used for the text in the external design can also be specified. Ensure that font names that include one or more spaces are put between quotes (inverted commas). An example would be: 'Times New Roman'. If you specify more than one font, you need to use commas to separate them (e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif). When you do this, there is first a search to see whether the first font (e.g. Arial) is available. If it is not, the next font (e.g. Helvetica) is looked for. This step is repeated until the browser has found a font that it recognizes and can display.\n\nFor the '''font sizes''' practice has shown that it is beneficial if the same size is used for both input fields, in order to achieve a more consistent appearance. The '12px' (enter it without the quotation marks) size is very popular.\n\nYou can enter the '''Width of solution''' either as a percentage or in pixels. Ensure that the solution is aligned or stays fixed on the left-hand side of the browser window. If you wish to set the Umantis solution to a fixed width and have it aligned in the centre in the window, you need to set that up further below with general CSS inputs.\n\n[[File:Design_Generell.png|top|800px]]\n\n<em>* Width of solution</em>\n\n====Tabs====\n\nHere you can adjust the appearance of the main navigation. Note here that these settings behave differently, depending on whether you have set \"rounded corners\" or not. If you have not activated this option, all the tab settings apply here. The horizontal line that separates the main navigation area from the content area takes the values that are specified for \"Frame above\". This also applies if the \"rounded corners\" option has been activated, however one cannot influence the color and frame strength of the tabs oneself, no matter what one enters.\n\n====Left====\n\nThe color and font specifications used for the links apply to most of the links, but there are a couple of exceptions. For example, it does not impact on the font size of the main navigation. In our experience, you get the best visual appearance if you enter the same font sizes for the links as above for the \"Normal font size\" or \"Small font size\". You also have the choice of customizing the main statuses of a link. One of the most popular methods is to keep the font size and color the same everywhere. Only \"Color of link on mouse contact\" is easily changed so that one can see a difference, besides the change in the cursor, when you roll over a link.\n\n====Page title====\n\nFor the page titles, not only the font color and font size can be specified, but also the strength of the font and the background color. The variations \"normal\" and \"bold\" are those most commonly used to specify the strength of the font.\n\n====Form title====\n\nThe settings for the form titles behave in the same way as those for the page titles. The best results are usually obtained when the same settings are applied to the form titles and page titles.\n\n====Table header====\n\nFor the table headers' (column titles') font size, it is again best to use the same specifications as with \"Normal font size\" or \"Small font size\".\n\n====Chart entry====\n\nFor the chart headers' font size, it is again best to use the same specifications as with \"Normal font size\" or \"Small font size\".\n\n====Forms====\n\nHere you can set, for example, the width of the form. If you use percentages, the width is calculated relative to the total width of the solution. If you want the form to take up the entire width, set the value to \"100%\". The form's background colour can also be specified, and the font sizes and alignments of the various input fields and their labels can be changed. If you have not activated the \"rounded corners\" option you can also customize the form's horizontal and vertical frame. If you want to hide it, enter a frame strength of 0px for both input fields, i.e. for example enter the value \"0px solid #000000\" for \"Frame above\" and \"Frame right\". The settings also have an effect if the \"rounded corners\" option has been activated, but they will have unattractive results. An exception is if the 0px frame strength is used to hide the frame.\n\n====Separation line====\n\nIn some forms, the input fields are divided into logical groups using separation lines. For these separation lines you can change the background color, font and frame color and the font size.\n\n====Linked text in list views====\n\nDoes not currently have any impact on the external design.\n\n====Linked text in list view====\n\nDoes not currently have any impact on the external design.\n\n====Linked subtitle in list views====\n\nHere a few of the main links in lists can be displayed differently to normal links. This setting has an impact on, for example, the job market in applicant management. It means that the job title, in particular, can be highlighted.\n\n====General CSS====\n\nThis is really the most important input field if you want to really customize a design very specifically and on a large scale. However, to do this, HTML and CSS skills are required as you need to write CSS into this input field if you want to customize the design.<br /> It is also very useful if you have access to one or two tools. For Internet Explorer there is the \"IE Developer Toolbar\" (IE9 has it installed by default). If you have not yet installed it, it is best to google \"IE Developer Toolbar\" and the top hit should take you straight to the correct download page. Once it has been successfully installed into Internet Explorer, the tool can be opened with the F12 key. The equivalent for Firefox is called \"Firebug\" and can also be opened with F12 once it has been successfully installed. Both tools enable the user to, e.g., find out the page structure or particular class names so that you can use CSS to really control the elements that you want to customize.\n\n==Actions==\n*  Reset design to default"

'''[[Job platform providers|Job platform providers]]''' such as '''Unio''', '''Prospective Media (PMS)''' and '''Publiconnect''' work in such a way that the HR expert uses the relevant links for the job to jump to the third-party platform and there maintain the text of the advertisement and all the publication options. This is where he selects the media and posts the job advertisement online for each medium. \n\n*  The link to the application form for the job in umantis is always sent too.\n\n*  With '''Broadbean''', the text of the advertisement is entered in umantis, transmitted to Broadbean by the interface, and from there prepared for publication on different media. (see [[Job platforms|Job platforms]]) \n\n*  In contrast to [[Job platform providers|Job Platform Providers]], which may be specified in umantis, any number of '''[[Job platforms|Job Platforms]]''' may be added. As soon as the connection of a [[Job platforms|Job platform]] is established in umantis, the action \"Create job advertisement\" allow the activation of the advertisement for the respective job platform. Analogously, the job advertisement may be deactivated again via \"Cancel job\".\n\n*  If your company uses more than one umantis applicant management system and only one applicant management system can form the main job market on your homepage, a job can also be published by applicant management on the homepage via another '''umantis applicant management'''.

If duplicate images appear in the job overview in the external job market, it is recommended to hide the second picture again via the [[Configuration mode|Configuration mode]].\n*  In case there are [[Performance|Performance problems]] occur when loading the job advertisement overviews, reduce the display with the help of [[Configuration mode#Customize table|Configuration mode (Configure the table)]] to 10 lines.\n\n==Options for job advertisements==\n*  For each job, you can specify '''Search criteria''' (entry as division, employment type, term) under which the advertisement is to be found on the job markets. \n*  Among the <em>Search criteria</em> a job may be highlighted by means of a \"'''Priority marking'''\" as particularly important, and will therefore appear permanently at the top in the job market.   \n*  You can specify that '''only offline applications''' are allowed. This means that applicants cannot apply for the job online. \n*  If you want to allow applications even if the job has not been published on a platform, check '''Applications without job advertisement possible'''.\n\n*  There is an option to only publish the advertisement in particular branch offices.\n\n*  You can select whether the job advertisement is published with a custom '''Advertisment layout''' rather than the standard layout.\n\n*  Reminders are also possible.\n\n==Advertisement statistics==\n\nVarious statistics regarding an advertisement are provided, such as the number of applicants that have viewed the job advertisement.\n\n'''Number of visitors:'''<br /> The number of visitors indicates how many applicants have viewed a job advertisement, i.e. how many have called up the advertisement. One of the ways that a statistic for the number of visitors is provided is on a job market specific-basis, i.e. separately for both the internal and external job market, as well as for each of the active advertisement languages. In addition to the job market-specific visitor statistic, the '''total number of visitors''' is displayed, which in turn indicates the total of all job market-specific visitor statistics. <br /><br />\n\n<br />\n\n==Adaptive selection lists==\n\n [[File:Adaptive Auswahllisten.JPG|thumb|490px|Fig. 1: Visualization of the adaptive selection lists]]Adaptive selection lists are used to facilitate retrieval of vacancies on the [[Internal publication|internal]] and on the [[External job advertisement|external]] job market. Unlike with 'normal' selection lists, adaptive selection lists only display those selection values that have advertised vacancies on the respective job market. The selection list thus relate to the vacancies advertised in the respective job market. Various job markets can thus have different selection lists. After loading the job market, the lists remain static and no longer change with the application of additional search criteria. \n\n[[File:info.gif|info.gif]] The update interval of adaptive selection lists is 60 minutes. \n\nWith adaptive selection lists, the behavior of a 'branch-specific selection list' can be managed, among other tasks.<br /> If, for example, a company has a branch in the United States and accordingly advertised vacancies in this region, then only these suggestions will be displayed from the cross-branch selection list when making an entry. Vice versa, in a European branch of the same company, consequently only list entries for the jobs advertised in Europe will be displayed.\n\n<br />\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable justify\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the adjacent figure 1\n\n|-\n| \n\nA company has a branch in the USA (job market A) and one in Europe (job market B). The selection lists are identical for all the branches. This means that in the search operation in a branch-specific job market, values ​​are only displayed as recommendations, which are actual components of the advertised vacancies in this job market.\n\n|}\n\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n==Advertising texts==\n\nAdvertisement text can be [[Format writing|formatted]] using particular special characters. For more advanced formatting, HTML tags can be used. \n\n* The job title and the short description which are also displayed in the published jobs table (job market) cannot be separately formatted. These are meant to be standard for every job. \n* The ad only shows text blocks with contents. \n\nTo put the text blocks in a different sequence in the advertisement and to insert graphic elements, we recommend that you use HTML advertisement layouts. These need to be developed in advance and uploaded to umantis so that they are available to be assigned to the advertising text. You will find more details on this under [[Create advertisement layout|Create ad layouts]].\n\n<br />\n\n==Integration of a video in job advertisement==\n\numantis offers the option, to also display videos in job advertisements. The following steps need to be taken\n\n*  In an ad template, integrate the filed [Inserat.Titel6] in an iFrame. Example: &lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=[Inserat.Titel6] frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n*  Enter the URL of the video in the \"Link for video\" field, at the desired location in the job advertisement text.\n\n<br />\n\n==More information==\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:BM Webseminar August 09-3.swf|Excerpt from webinar on the topic of advertising a job (14 min.)]]\n\n<br />\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  [[Publish vacancy|Creating job advertisements]]\n*  [[Internal publication|Internal job advertisment]] and [[Positions published on the intranet|internal job market (Intranet)]]\n*  [[External job advertisement|External job advertisement]] and [[Positions published externally|external job market]]\n*  [[Job platforms|Job platforms]]\n*  [[Job platform providers|Job platform providers]]\n*  [[RSS feeds|RSS feeds]]\n*  [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n*  [[Job description (applicant management)|Job description]]\n*  [[Approving jobs|Approval process]]\n*  [[Assessment|Assessment process]]\n*  [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]\n*  [[Applications / applicants overview|Applicants overview]]\n*  [[Appointments|Appointments]]\n*  [[Reminders|Reminders]]\n*  [[Job advertisement contents|Advertisement contents]]"

This means that applicants cannot apply for the job online. \n*  If you want to allow applications even if the job has not been published on a platform, check '''Applications without vacancy notice'''.\n\n*  There is an option to only publish the advertisement in particular branch offices.\n\n*  You can select whether the vacancy notice is published with a custom '''advertising layout''' rather than the standard layout.\n\n*  Reminders are also possible.\n\n==Advertisement statistics==\n\nVarious statistics regarding an advertisement are provided, such as the number of applicants that have viewed the job advertisement.\n\n'''Number of visitors:'''<br /> The number of visitors indicates how many applicants have viewed a job advertisement, i.e. how many have called up the advertisement. One of the ways that a statistic for the number of visitors is provided is on a job market specific-basis, i.e. separately for both the internal and external job market, as well as for each of the active advertisement languages. In addition to the job market-specific visitor statistic, the '''total number of visitors''' is displayed, which in turn indicates the total of all job market-specific visitor statistics. <br /><br />\n\n==Adaptive selection lists==\n\n[[File:Adaptive Auswahllisten.JPG|thumb|490px|Fig. 1: Visualization of adaptive selection lists]]Adaptive selection lists are used to facilitate retrieval of vacancies on the [[Internal publication|internal]] and on the [[External publication|external]] job market. Unlike with 'normal' selection lists, adaptive selection lists only display those selection values that have advertised vacancies on the respective job market. The selection list thus relate to the vacancies advertised in the respective job market. Various job markets can thus have different selection lists. After loading the job market, the lists remain static and no longer change with the application of additional search criteria. \n\nWith adaptive selection lists, the behaviour of a 'branch-specific selection list' can be managed, among other tasks.<br /> If, for example, a company has a branch in the United States and accordingly advertised vacancies in this region, then only these suggestions will be displayed from the cross-branch selection list when making an entry. Vice versa, in a European branch of the same company, consequently only list entries for the jobs advertised in Europe will be displayed.\n\n<br />\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable justify\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the adjacent Figure 1\n\n|-\n| \n\nA company has a branch in the USA (job market A) and one in Europe (job market B). The selection lists are identical for all the branches. This means that in the search operation in a branch-specific job market, values ??are only displayed as recommendations, which are actual components of the advertised vacancies in this job market.\n\n|}\n\n<br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n==Advertising texts==\n\nAdvertisement text can be [[Format writing|formatted]] using particular special characters. For more advanced formatting, HTML tags can be used. \n\n* The job title and the short description which are also displayed in the published jobs table (job market) cannot be separately formatted. These are meant to be standard for every job. \n* The ad only shows text blocks with contents. \n\nTo put the text blocks in a different sequence in the advertisement and to insert graphic elements, we recommend that you use HTML advertisement layouts. These need to be developed in advance and uploaded to umantis so that they are available to be assigned to the advertising text. You will find more details on this under [[Create advertisement layout|Create ad layouts]].\n\n<br />\n\n==Integration of a video in job advertisement==\n\numantis offers the option, to also display videos in job advertisements. The following steps need to be taken\n\n*  In an ad template, integrate the filed [Inserat.Titel6] in an iFrame. Example: &lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=[Inserat.Titel6] frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n*  Enter the URL of the video in the \"Link for video\" box, at the desired location in the job ad text.\n\n<br />\n\n==More information==\n*  [[File:Movie.gif|Movie.gif]] [[Media:BM Webseminar August 09-3.swf|Excerpt from webinar on the topic of advertising a vacancy (14 min.)]]\n\n<br />\n\n==Related Subjects==\n*  [[Creating a vacancy notice|Creating vacancy notices]]\n*  [[Internal publication|Internal vacancy notice]] and [[Positions published on the intranet|internal job market (Intranet)]]\n*  [[External publication|External vacancy notice]] and [[Positions published externally|external job market]]\n*  [[Job platforms]]\n*  [[Job platform providers]]\n*  [[RSS feeds]]\n*  [[Automatic exports]]\n*  [[Job description (applicant management)|Job description]]\n*  [[Approving jobs|Approval process]]\n*  [[Assessment|Assessment process]]\n*  [[Selection criteria]]\n*  [[Applications / applicants overview]]\n*  [[Appointments]]\n*  [[Reminders]]\n*  [[Job advertisement contents]]"

Postings for publication to the internal job board (intranet) generally have to be written separately; this is done under the “[[Internal publication|Internal job posting]]” tab.\n\nJobs can be published in all active [[Languages|languages]]. Individual navigation of languages allows for switching between publication languages. However, in order to make it immediately clear when opening the “Publication” tab whether a job is published in a given place in such a way as to allow for the submission of online applications, this is clearly marked above the actions on the left: \n: [[File:Dot_red.gif]] A red dot means that online applications are not possible\n: [[File:Dot_brightgreen.gif]] A green dot indicates that online applications are possible through some channel or in some language\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Other information about publication can be found in Umantis Applicant Management, e.g.: \n:* Publication language: ''(Language)''\n:* Last modified on: ''(Date)''\n:* Last modified by: ''(Name)''\n\n==Publication channels==\nTo publish a job externally, a number of channels are available:\n\n'''Your company’s own job board''' (Home page)''':'''<br>\n* For companies with multiple branch offices, you also have the option when publishing to your own job board to select whether the job should only be posted on the '''Head office’s job board''', the '''Job board for this branch office''', or on both. To find out which addresses can actually be used to access the different job boards, see [[Integrating applicant management|Integrating Applicant Management]].\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' \n\n* On the left side (action bar) under the title “Your company’s own job board”, you will see the '''“Publish job” action'''. Please note that applying this action will automatically publish the job to both the head office’s job board and the job board for the branch office linked to this job. If you have not used the “permanent filter” ?CompanyID=x to integrate your job board (e.g. /Jobs/All?CompanyID=1 or /Jobs/1?CompanyID=8), then this note does not apply, since both publication variants have the same effect.<br>\n\n'''Publication platforms:'''<br>\n* A publication platform is its own web application, and provides the option to publish a job over different media (newspapers, job boards). '''With [[Job board provider|job board providers]]''' like '''Unio''', '''Prospective Media (PMS)''' and '''Publiconnect''', an HR expert uses the links associated with the job to navigate to the third-party platform, where they can then manage the job posting text and all the publication options. They then select the desired media, and put the job posting online for each of those channels. \n\n* The link to the application form for the job in Umantis is always sent along too.\n\n* With '''Broadbean''', the job posting text is created in Umantis, transferred to Broadbean via the interface, and then prepared from there for publication to different media. (see [[Job boards|Job boards]]) \n\n* Unlike [[Job board provider|job board providers]], which must be specified statically in Umantis, you can set up as many '''[[Job boards|job boards]]''' as you like. One the connection for a [[Job boards|job board]] has been set up in Umantis, the “Publish job” action can be used to activate the job posting for the appropriate job board. Similarly, you can deactivate a job posting using “Withdraw job”.\n \n* If you use multiple instances of Umantis Applicant Management in your company and only one Applicant Management instance can serve as the main job board on your home page, then a job can also be posted by one AM instance to the home page of another '''Umantis Applicant Management''' instance. Details about the connection can be found under [[Job board provider|Job board providers]].\n\n<br>\n'''Other publication channels:'''<br>\n* [[RSS Feeds|RSS feeds]]\n* [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n<br>\nBesides the external publication channels described above, Umantis also gives you the option to publish jobs internally (to your intranet); (see [[Internal publication|Internal job postings]]).\n<br><br>\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Notes:'''\n\n* To ensure that job postings on the external job board (/Jobs/All) have a consistent appearance, you should never activate more than one job posting image in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]]. If you are seeing duplicated images in the jobs overview on the external job board, it is recommended that you hide the second image via [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]].\n* If [[Performance|performance problems]] occur when loading the job posting overviews, use [[Configuration mode#Configure table|Configuration mode (configure tables)]] to reduce the number of rows displayed to 10.\n* If your job posting is not displayed, even though you have selected a job posting layout, turn off the Google Analytics Web Tracking snipper (if it has been activated); or, if you use the snippet, check whether the posting can still be displayed.\n\n==Publication options==\n* You can specify '''search criteria''' for each job (Starting as, Department, Employment category, Employment period) which can be used to find the posting on the job boards. \n* In the job description, you can use “'''priority marking'''” to mark a job as particularly important, causing that job to always appear at the very top of the job board. In addition, users can then search for these jobs in the jobs overview (by checking the box for “Priorities”).   \n* You can specify in the settings that '''only offline applications''' will be accepted. This means that applicants cannot apply for the job online. \n* If you want to allow applications even when the job is not published on any platform, check the box for “'''Applications allowed for unpublished job'''”. This can be useful, for example, if the application process is \"officially\" over, but recruiters are still submitting applications. They can still do this via the corresponding URL. \n* You have the option to publish the job posting only to certain branch offices.\n* You can select whether the job should be published with its own '''job posting layout''' instead of the default job posting layout.\n* Reminders are also available.\n\n==Publication statistics==   \nVarious statistics are available for each published job posting, such as the number of applicants who have viewed a given posting.\n\t\n'''Number of visitors:'''<br>\nThe number of visitors indicates how many applicants have looked at a job posting, i.e. how many times the job posting has been viewed. Among other options, the statistic for the number of visitors is available on a job board-specific basis, i.e. both for the internal and external job boards individually and for each of the active publication languages. In addition to job board-specific visitor statistics, the '''total number of visitors''' is displayed; this indicates the sum of all job board-specific visitor statistics.\t\n<br><br>\n\n==Adaptive selection lists==\n[[File:Adaptive Auswahllisten.JPG|thumb|490px|Fig. 1: Visualization of adaptive selection lists]]Adaptive selection lists make it easier to find published jobs on both the [[Internal publication|internal]] and [[External vacancy notice|external]] job boards. In contrast to “normal” selection lists, adaptive selection lists only show the selection values that correspond to actual published jobs on the given job board. The selection lists thus reflect the jobs that are currently published on the given job board. As a result, different job boards may have different selection lists. Once the job board has been loaded, the lists remain static and no longer change if other search filters are used. Adaptive selection lists are used automatically, since they '''cannot be configured specifically for individual users'''. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note:'''\n: Adaptive selection lists '''do not work''' if a job board has been configured for '''multiple''' branch offices (e.g. CompanyID=19|15|1). The job board must either be unrestricted or be configured for '''one''' specific branch office (e.g. CompanyID=19). See also: [[Positions published on the intranet#URL structure and parameters for the job board|URL structure and parameters for job board]]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The update interval for adaptive selection lists is 60 minutes. \n\nWith adaptive selection lists, you can set up branch office-specific selection list behavior.<br />\nFor instance, if a company has a branch office in the United States and therefore has published jobs in that region, then only these suggestions will be displayed from the global selection list when entering data. Conversely, for a European branch office of the same company, only the list entries for jobs published in Europe will be shown.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable justify\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 1\n|-\n|\nA company has one branch office in the United States (job board A) and one in Europe (job board B). The selection lists are identical for all branch offices. When searching on a branch office-specific job board, therefore, the only values that will be shown as suggestions are those that actually appear in jobs published on this job board.\n|}\n<br><br><br><br><br>\n\n=Publication contents=\n(see the article on [[Job advertisement contents|Publication contents]])\n\n==Job posting texts==\nThe job posting text can be [[Format writing|formatted]] using specific special characters. HTML tags can be used for other types of formatting. \n\n*No special formatting is available for the job title or brief description which also appear in the table of published jobs (job board). This should be consistent across all jobs. \n*In the job posting, text blocks are only displayed if they have content. \n\nTo reorder the text blocks in the job posting or to add graphical elements, it is recommended that you work with HTML job posting layouts. These must be built in advance and uploaded to Umantis so that they can then be selected for assignment to the job posting text when publishing a job. For more details, see [[Create advertisement layout|Create job posting layouts]].\n\n==History==\nThe history is found on the “Publication” tab in the view of a job. It includes the following information:\n* '''History of publications on the company’s own job board (''Language'')'''\n: Publication information: \n:* ''Published on'' \n:* ''Published until'' \n:* ''Published by''\n:* ''On websites''\n* '''History of job board publications (''Language'')''' \n* '''History of SOAP calls for publications (''Language'')''' \n* [[Job board provider|Publiconnect]] XML\n* [[Job board provider|Solique]] XML\n\n==Integrating a video in a job posting==\nUmantis also lets you include videos in your job postings. To do this, follow the steps below.\n* In a job posting template, integrate the field [Inserat.Titel6] in an iFrame. Example: <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=[Inserat.Titel6] frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n* In the job posting text for the given job, enter the URL for the video in the “Link for video” field.\n\n\n==Additional information==\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:BM Webseminar August 09-3.swf|Extract from webinar on Publishing a job (14 min)]]\n\n\n== Related topics ==\n* [[Publish vacancy|Publishing jobs]]\n* [[Internal publication|Internal job postings]] and [[Positions published on the intranet|Internal job board (intranet)]]\n* [[External vacancy notice|External job postings]] and [[Positions published externally|External job board]]\n* [[Job boards|Job boards]]\n* [[Job board provider|Job board providers]]\n* [[RSS Feeds|RSS feeds]]\n* [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n* [[Job description (applicant management)|Position description]]\n* [[Approving jobs|Approval process]]\n* [[Assessment|Assessment process]]\n* [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]\n* [[Applications / Applicants overview|Applicant overview]]\n* [[Appointments|Appointments]]\n* [[Reminders|Reminders]]\n* [[Job advertisement contents|Publication contents]]"

As a general rule, users are encouraged by the new editor to format/design texts. Accordingly, HTML formatting is saved in the background as well. However, this stored content may in certain circumstances not be correctly interpreted in other media (for instance in print templates). There the content may be displayed without formatting and include HTML tags. \n\nIf HTML tags are displayed in an email you originally wrote as “plain text” (via normal text field), for instance, we recommend the following solutions: \n* Explicit use of HTML emails — if this is not possible: switching off the WYSIWYG text editor for fields from which variables are used for emails\n* Workaround: see [[Variables#Modifying variables for a specific output format|Modification of variables for a specific issue]]\n\n\n====Allow images from external sources (not recommended)====\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note''': See the instructions in the [[Configuration mode#Configure data fields -— HTML security restriction|Configure data fields — HTML security restriction]]. \n\nIn the case of fields that allow the integration of images using WYSIWYG editor, the following restriction options exist in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] under '''HTML security restriction''':\n* '''with restriction''' (recommended setting)\n: This restriction only allows the integration of images that have already been uploaded into your Umantis solution. This restriction prevents integration from external sources.\n* '''without restriction''' (setting not recommended) \n: This setting allows you to integrate images from external sources. It is not recommended to allow or integrate external content as this may come from dubious sources. In this way, damaging or copyrighted content may be integrated by mistake.\n\n==Notes on the use of HMTL tags==\nPlease note that basically '''only HTML5 tags''' are supported. Additionally, not all tags are supported by us here either. Of course, we support all tags that you can use directly via the WYSIWYG editor. In addition, other tags can be used via the text input, but here you have to reckon with the fact that not all tags are supported by us, or in some cases not even a saving of these tags is allowed. \n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px\"> '''The following HTML5 tags are currently allowed and can be saved:''' <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n* p\n* div\n* span\n* br\n* table\n* td\n* tr\n* th\n* thead\n* tfoot\n* tbody\n* a\n* img\n* pre\n* b\n* strong\n* i\n* h1 - h6\n* ul\n* li\n* ol\n* u\n* sup\n* sub\n* hr\n* em\n* del\n* head\n* body\n* form\n* input\n* title\n* alt\n* iframe\n</div></div>\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note, however, that not all attributes of these HTML tags are necessarily allowed (for example, the \"class\" attribute, which is used very intensively by MS products in HTML exports).\n\n==Formatting commands==\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| |'''Formatting'''||'''Insert:'''||'''Visible:'''\n|- \t\n|Bold|| * Text * ||'''Text'''\n|-\n|Italic||_Text_||''Text''\n|-\n||Bullets||(-) Text (-)||• Text\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Combination options\n|*_Text_*||'''''Text'''''\n|-\n|*_Text_Text_*||'''Text''' ''Text''\n|-\n|_Text*Text*_||''Text'' '''''Text'''''\n|}\n\n<br>\n'''Note:'''<br>\nThe following applies for all formatting:\n* there must be a space before the first ( and after the last )<br>\n* there must be a space before the first * and after the last *<br>\n* there must be a space before the first _ and after the last _\nMake sure that the texts to be formatted are not broken up with “Enter” but are keyed in as continuous text.

This action sends a personalized email to the people selected to provide assessments, with a link for the solution and the relevant applicant. This link contains a parameter token that identifies the user and allows them to access the assessment form without additional login data. \n<br>\n\n'''Notes:'''\n* Be sure to check the settings (if any) configured under ''[[Security settings#Password|Authentication key validity (number of days)]]''\n* The third-party assessor will be able to see all elements in the application that were actually released (by the person with access permissions) at the time the invitation to submit an assessment was sent.\n* An application can only be assessed by third parties as long as the application is still '''active''' (i.e. has not yet been archived or anonymized).\n* If an application that was forwarded to a third party for assessment has since been archived, an error message will be displayed (403).\n* In general, the action to release an application is available to both the [[User roles in Applicant Management#Company-internal users|HR expert]] and the [[User roles in Applicant Management#Company-internal users|hiring manager]].\n\n'''Automated reminder email for outstanding assessments''' <br> \n[[File:info.gif]] You can configure how many days must pass before a reminder email is sent to invited third-party assessors. Further information in the section [[Superior evaluation#Automated reminder email for outstanding assessments|Automated reminder email for outstanding assessments]]. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Please note:''' Whether the reminder email is sent does not depend on an application’s current status. The background context here is that application statuses can be freely defined by the customer. What determines whether a reminder email is sent out is whether the application has been released for the manager view (“Release to managers” is active). In other words, only when the application has actually been assessed, or if the release to managers is explicitly withdrawn, will the system stop sending reminder emails to managers or third-party assessors about evaluating the application. The same is true for applications that have been archived or anonymized.\n\n; Warning message, if you invite yourself or invite other persons again\nIf you want to get a third party evaluation for an application and you enter a person (e-mail address) who has already been invited, you will be informed about this. If you enter '''your own e-mail address''', you will also be informed of this. This helps to avoid unnecessary duplications and obsolete invitations to the third party assessment. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] You also have the option to send the invitation anyway, as the hint message offers both options (\"Yes, send now\" or \"No, change now\").\nThe hint messages currently appear only if the restriction [[#Forward to third party with a user profile|Allow third party assessment only by people with user profile]] '''not''' is active.\n\n==Forward to third party with a user profile==\nYou can make restrictions and limit the invitation to third-party assessment only for persons with a user profile (of your Haufe Applicant management). In this way, you avoid, among other things, that appraisal requests are sent to external persons by mistake. In addition, the user/third-party appraiser can be found and selected more quickly via the selection provided.\n\nThe restriction is optional and can be set via the settings of the respective [[Branches#Settings|Branch]] (''/Administration/Agency/ID/Settings/ApplicationProcess''). Here, the checkbox '''Allow third-party assessment by persons with a user profile only ''' is activated. Subsequently, in the application dossier, instead of \"Forward to third party\", another action button is displayed: \"'''Forward to third party with a user profile'''\", which leads to an optimized invitation screen. This screen allows both searching and quick selection of users (people with user profile in the system).\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''If forwarding is only possible to persons with user profile:'''\n* the third party appraisers will see an overview of all applications sent to you via third party appraisal under ''/SelfServiceAppraisals'';\n* the use of the LoginKey is no longer necessary. This is therefore not required in the corresponding [[Email|email]] templates.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Forward application for evaluation to other people (third parties)|Forward application to other people for assessment (third parties)]]\n* [[Activate for committees / retract committee access|Release to committees]]\n* [[Activate for committees / retract committee access|Withdraw access from committees]]\n* [[Activate for line manager area (and send email)|Release for hiring manager view]]\n* [[HR evaluation|HR assessment]]\n* [[Superior evaluation|Manager assessment]]\n* [[Communication about the application|Communication]]\n* [[Linking using emails in applicant management|Linking using emails in Applicant Management]]"

For example, you can search for terms through entire employee profiles including their attached documents. The search results overview shows, in short text extracts, the context in which the term has been found. Other languages may appear in this context, because all translations of the selection list values must be included in the index in order to be found in all languages.  \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Important notes:'''\n\n* Full-text search is only available in the jobs and applications overview (Applicant Management) and in the employee overview (Employee Management). \n* In the application documents, only the '''automatic''' [[Generate PDF summary|PDF compilation]] is indexed. Therefore, if no automatic PDF compilation could be generated for a given application, full-text search will not return any results for that application.\n* '''Search string cannot exceed 200 characters'''<br> No more than 200 characters can be entered in a search field; otherwise, an error message will appear: ''You have entered more than 200 characters''\n* You can identify full-text search fields from the comment directly below the search field: ''“Finds terms with the identical root word (more...)”'', which, in turn, links back here.\n* Full-text search in Haufe is optimized to return search results as quickly as possible. For this reason, full-text search automatically excludes search terms that would return more than 15,000 search results. \n* [[File:attention.gif]] Experience shows that full-text search is not as stable as other search options in the Haufe solution. Since it relies on regular indexing of the fields, a search term might not be found right away after re-indexing. Depending on the amount of data that is/has been entered into the system (manually or through an import), and the various (complex) processes that then result, a complete re-indexing can take up to 24 hours in the worst case. For this reason, full-text search may not work 100% correctly at all times.\n\n==Key features==\n* Only whole words are indexed — and accordingly, only whole words can be found. The term “employee file”, for example, is not found if you have searched for “employee” or “file”.\n\n* Stemming works. If you search for a grammatical variation of a word, all the other variations will be found too, for example: search, searches, searching\n\n* More than one word can be searched for. By default, the AND operator is used for conjoining terms. However, the OR operator may also be used. Note that the operators must be written in capital letters.\n\n* A maximum of 200 characters can be entered in the search box.\n\n* You can search for character strings if they are placed between double quotes.\n\n* Search is supported for the following document types: Word, PDF, RTF, HTML, TXT, Open Office\n\n* Wildcards / placeholders (*, ?) do not work.\n\n==Searched entities in Haufe Applicant Management==\nIn this section, you will find all entities and associated variables that are covered by Haufe full-text search.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"

Any problems that may arise often resolve themselves within 24 hours.\n* Note that an automatic PDF compilation is '''always''' created from all documents in supported file formats. In addition, the user is informed of which documents have an unsupported file format (such as .mp3, .avi, etc.) and are therefore not included in the PDF compilation. In this way, the HR expert (for example) knows throughout the entire process which documents are still part of the application and therefore relevant to the application process, but not included in the PDF compilation."

They are usually also the owners of the application, and therefore responsible for activating new functions after Haufe has updated the application.  Administrators have the most rights, compared with other roles. They can change almost any setting and adapt them to the company's requirements.

Succession planning well in advance is particularly essential for jobs that have been defined as critical [[Job profile (employee management)#Identification of key positions|key positions]].

Here you can export and re-import the view texts and assistant steps, diagram title, dynamic lists and employee review meeting catalogues.\n\nThere is a basic way of changing text (labels, column headers, navigation, help text). However, it is more time-consuming than other ways. It is particularly well suited to moving any changes that have been made to other languages. If you want to ensure that all of the changes that you make to the view texts in the solution are consistent across one or more languages, you should use the import / export function.\n\nThe process for changing such texts is as follows:\n\n*  You are going to have the view texts exported. \n*  The editing is done in Excel (*.csv file). You may need to call in a translation service provider. \n*  When the change has been made you can reimport the file. \n\n==Actions==\n*  Export view texts\n*  Export assistant steps\n*  Export diagram title\n*  Export dynamic lists\n*  Export employee review meeting catalogues\n*  Import texts\n\n==Step by step==\n\nThis guide applies to exporting view texts, assistant steps, diagram title, dynamic lists and employee review meeting catalogues.\n\nIf you have created a CSV file, it is formatted by Haufe UTF8. As it is very difficult to further process a CSV manually, it can be imported into Excel.\n\n*  1. Open a new Excel document\n*  2. Go to \"Data\" -&gt; \"Import from text\"\n*  3. Select the CSV file with the view texts.\n*  4. Select the following options to fill the columns: \"delimited\", file source 65001 Unicode(UTF-8), \"comma delimited\", text identification \"\n*  5. -&gt; Finish\n*  6. Add (have added) translations\n*  7. Go to Settings-View Texts-import/export-Import texts\n*  8. Select the file to be imported\n*  9. Select the import type (E.g. Excel import: assistant steps)\n* 10. Start the import: \"Start import\" (the import can take a few minutes, depending on the volume of data)\n\n\n<br />\n\n==Tips and tricks==\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]] Columns A, B and C must not be changed or no re-import is guaranteed.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]] In column G \"RenamedGerman\" you will find the texts that you have changed in German which are to be translated to the relevant languages.

Please check if the variables you use are valid before importing. \n; The following files contain all supported variables that you can use when performing: \n* [https://de.onlinehelp.umantis.com/images/3/36/Recruitingapp.zip XML import in Umantis Applicant Management (recruitingapp)]\n:and/or\n* [https://de.onlinehelp.umantis.com/images/5/5a/Employeeapp.zip XML import in Umantis Employee Management (employeeapp)]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The .xsd files contained in the ZIP files can be opened with the Editor or Notepad++.\n\nThe following pages provide specific import templates and additional information about:\n:* [[Imports in Applicant Management|Imports in Applicant Management]]\n:* [[Imports in Employee Management|Imports in Employee Management]]\n|}\n__TOC__\nYou can import data from a system or Excel lists into your Umantis solution by applying the most efficient method and using the appropriate templates for the import. Another option here is to set up an [[Automatic imports|automatic import]]. Under the Imports tab, you can access the imports overview as an [[User roles in Applicant Management#Administrator|administrator (Applicant Management)]]. Employee Management also allows you to do imports using the [[User roles in the employee management system#Imports|Imports module role]].\n\n==Procedure during an import==\n# The data format used for your data is crucial in determining the type of import (Excel or XML). Select the appropriate [[Imports#Import templates (Employee Management)|template]], save it, and enter your data. A new row should be selected for each entry. The example row should not be used as this is not imported. \n# In the Umantis solution, navigate to the Imports tab and select the corresponding action for the import (identical to the above section assignment for the templates)\n# You can then define a title for the import in this window and upload the completed template.\n# Various [[Imports|Import settings]] can also be defined.\n# Click on “Start import” to begin the import process.\n# A [[Imports#Status information during the import|status report window]] informs you of the import’s current status.\n# A confirmation message is displayed when the import is complete.\n# The data can now be found at the relevant target location as usual.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] If a record cannot be imported, check the import for errors in the log file (search for “Error”) and re-import the record after correcting it.<br>\n\nDetailed information on the import process and status information during the process can be found under [[Imports#Run import — Options|Run import]].\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important notes:'''\n* '''Importing organizational units:''' If organizational units (use the “Selection list” template) are to be imported, proceed as follows: Import the organizational units first using the templates, then check the solution whether they have been imported correctly (focus on the connections with the individual organizational units, which can be found under: Basic settings -> Selection lists -> Organizational units) and import the relevant employees affected by this change (including their organizational unit and access rights).\n\n* For '''user-defined fields''', the column name may be changed in the template, provided that the name has also been changed accordingly in the solution. Never change the variables in the templates, however, as this will prevent the import from working.\n* You can use the import to '''assign a manager''' to each person. To do this, enter the details you activated for the manager (employee ID, position ID, external system abbreviation) into the corresponding column for each subordinate employee.\n\n* The following presentation provides a description of the '''import logic''', and especially of the interaction of '''import keys''' for unique identification of the imported employees, persons, positions or organizational units: [[Media:MM Import und Schlüssel.pdf|Help with using the import keys]]. The '''import keys''' can be alphanumeric and, ideally, should not include any spaces. Leading zeros are not suitable for purely numeric import keys.\n\n* You can '''compress all your import files using [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip''gzip'' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip ''gzip'’]'''. This is especially helpful for large import files: Compressing a file reduces the amount of digital data needed to represent it, which in turn reduces the necessary storage space and file transfer time. We recommend that you compress XML files using ''gzip'' , since this file type works especially well with compression techniques.\n\n==Run import — Options==\nThere are various options available to you when creating a new import, which are explained below.<br>\nThe import process can also be tracked using [[Imports#Status information during the import|system feedback]].\n\n===Partial imports vs. full imports===\nPartial imports and full imports differ only in that the full import historizes the remaining data (which has not been sent in the import) after importing the data that is passed in the import file. Historization is only performed within the same source system.\n====Same source system====\n[[File:Teil- vs. Komplettimport.JPG|thumb|left|550px|Fig. 1: Full vs. partial import from the same source system]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 1: Full vs. partial import from the same source system\n|-\n|\nIf a '''full import''' is performed with data within the '''same source system''', the process is as follows:\n*The new data '''replace''' the existing data in the system.\n*Import data that are both part of the old and the new import are updated accordingly.\n*The old data are '''historized'''.\nIf a '''partial import''' is performed with data within the'''same source system''', the existing data are updated and supplemented; however, the already existing data '''will not be historized'''.<br />\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] If an employee who has already been historized in the solution is imported again in the full import, he/she will not be reactivated. There is an exception to this if the column for the ''Stelle.Aktualitaet'' variable contains the value “current”.\n|}\n<br /><br /><br />\n\n====From different source systems====\n[[File:Ausgangslage zwei Quellsysteme.JPG|thumb|left|460px|Fig. 2: Two different source systems as a starting point]]\n<br /><br /><br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 2: Introduction\n|-\n|\nData is to be imported into two source systems and the Umantis solution.\n*SAP CH source system with person records for Brad, Angelina and George.\n*SAP DE source system that contains a person record for Til.\n|}\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n=====Full import=====\n[[File:Komplettimport - unterschiedliches Quellsystem.JPG|thumb|left|630px|Fig. 3: Full import with different source systems]]\n<br /> <br /> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 3: Full import with different source systems\n|-\n|\nA '''full import''' with data from '''different source systems''' can be demonstrated briefly using an example:\n*The Umantis solution contains George from the SAP CH source system and Til from the SAP DE source system.\n*Angelina and Brad are imported from the SAP CH source system with a full import.\n*George is historized, because the SAP CH source data is replaced by the new import data.\n*Brad and Angelina from SAP CH and Til from SAP DE are now in the Umantis solution.\n|}\n<br /> <br /><br />\n\n=====Partial import=====\n[[File:Teilimport - unterschiedliches Quellsystem.JPG|thumb|left|630px|Fig. 4: Partial import with different source systems]]\n<br /> <br /> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 4: Partial import with different source systems\n|-\n|\nA '''partial import''' with data from '''different source systems''' can be demonstrated briefly using an example:\n*The Umantis solution contains Brad and George from the SAP CH source system and Til from the SAP DE source system.\n*Angelina and Brad are imported from the SAP CH source system with a partial import.\n*Brad, George and Angelina from SAP CH and Til from SAP DE are now in the Umantis solution. No historization takes place, as the existing data in the solution is only supplemented and updated.\n|}\n<br /> <br /> <br />\n\n''Notes:'' <br />\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] For selection lists 66 (organizational units) and 67 (matrix organizational units), the import works the same way with regard to partial vs. full imports as when importing employees. The system automatically aggregates a consolidated list of the imported entries from different source systems.\n\n===Delta import vs. Import all data===\nAlongside the distinction between ''Full import'' and ''Partial import'' a separate distinction is also made as to whether all data is to be imported or only data that differs from the last import (''delta import''). If the option to '''Import all records from the file''' is selected, all data will imported, regardless of the last import. If this option is selected, the import will take considerably longer than a delta import, because all records are processed, even if a record has not changed since the previous import. With the ''delta import'' , on the other hand, a check is run before importing to determine which data have changed relative to the last import, and only then only those data are imported. For the purposes of this comparison, the current import file is compared with the one from the previous import.<br>\n[[File:Deltaimport vs. alle Daten importieren.JPG|thumb|left|630px|Fig. 5: Comparison of Delta import vs. Import all data]]\n<br> <br> \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 5: Delta import vs. Import all data\n|-\n|\nThe '''delta import''' compares the data to be imported with those from the last import, and only updates the data for which differences are found. The remaining entries are retained 1:1. However, if '''all data is imported''', the entire record is processed.\n|}\n<br> <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Notes:'''<br>\n* Delta import cannot be deactivated for automatic import \n* In the import, the record is not compared with the current version in the database, but with the state of the previous import (import file). This comparison also works in cases where you are switching between partial and full imports.\n* If a record cannot be imported, check the import for errors in the log file (search for “Error”) and re-import the record after correcting it. In this case, you should also select the option to “Import all records in the file”. \n* The ''delta import'', in which only those records are imported that have changed since the previous import, is used only with the Employee and Jobs imports, and with the import of selection lists 66 and 67 (organizational units) with a code for each organizational unit. With all other imports, all records are always imported from the file.\n* The delta import is a performance optimization.\n\n===Other import options===\n* '''Import notification''': When an import finishes unsuccessfully (incomplete import), a message with the import status is sent to the [[Settings for company / organization profile#Email special settings|email address]] specified in the [[Settings for company / organization profile|organizational profile]].\n\n====Specify date format for imports====\nSpecify the date format for [[Imports|imports of records]] that contain date information. You can use the following variables for this:\n* '''''Datum.Format'''''\n: With this variable, specify the output format for each record (each line of your Excel template): \n:* D/M/YYYY\n:* D.M.YYYY\n:* M/D/YYYY \n:* M.D.YYYY\n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you do not explicitly define a specific date format, then the following date format is used: D.M.YYYY\n\n* '''''DatumZeit.Format'''''\n: With this variable, specify the output format for each record (each line of your Excel template): \n:* D/M/YYYY hh:mm\n:* D.M.YYYY hh:mm\n:* M/D/YYYY hh:mm \n:* M.D.YYYY hh:mm\n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you do not explicitly define a specific date/time format, then the following format is used: D.M.YYYY hh:mm\n\n===Status information during the import===\n\nContinuous status information is displayed during the import. Refresh your [[System requirements#Browser and operating system|browser]] to receive the most recent information on the current import status. The following messages can be displayed:\n\n;* Import file uploaded\n: The file was received -> OK/Error\n;* ZIP file uploaded\n: The second file with the possible files (e.g. photos) was received -> OK/Error\n;* Processing\n: The processing engine is operational -> OK/Error\n;* Import file checked\n: The file meets the basic requirements for the selected import type (e.g. file type) -> OK/Error\n;* ZIP file checked\n:  The second file meets the basic requirements for the selected import type (e.g. file type) -> OK/Error\n;* ZIP file extracted\n: The ZIP archive was successfully extracted -> OK/Error\n;* Number of entries\n: This number of entries was found in the import file for processing -> (Number of entries)\n;* Import all records from the file\n: For employees, only the delta relative to the previous import is typically written in the system (see [[#Import ausführen - Optionen|Options]]). Has this Delta function been deactivated, despite the considerably longer processing time? -> yes/no\n;* Number of changed entries in the import\n: Number of records that were changed since the previous import or are new -> (Number of entries)\n;* Process entries\n: Number of entries that were prepared for import. -> OK (Number of entries)\n;* Write entries\n: Number of entries that were written. If you see a difference here compared with “Process entries”, check the log. Progress in %  -> OK (Number of entries)\n;* Entries not fully imported\n: Number of entries that were not imported. You should consult the log file.\n;* Reorganize access permissions to OUs\n: Only applicable when importing selection lists 66 and 67 organizational units (OU) and matrix OU. If the OU structure was changed, employee authorizations need to be re-configured. This is a very time-consuming process if there is a large number of employees. <br> [[File:info.gif]] No special template is provided for a reorganization, since it cannot be predicted how the reorganization of employees will affect the import structure. In addition to the usual variables, the following can be used specifically in the case of a reorganization: [Quellsystem.NeuerSchluessel], [Person.NeuerSchluessel] and [Stelle.NeuerSchluessel]. After finding existing employees (using existing keys), these variables are used to “convert” the existing keys to the new ones. Please note that this process should be used with caution, and that any template you used can only be used once, since using it again will generate a duplicate.  \n\n;* Terminate\n: Entries that were not fully imported are deleted again and, in the case of a full import, non-imported entries from the same source system are historized.\n;* Log\n: Documentation of the entire import process\n\nThird-party systems can be isolated from one another using '''source system keys'''. For example, if you define a different source system key for each import, automatic archiving of non-imported employees or organizational units is only performed within the same source system. For example, this detects overlapping identical PersonKeys, and the employees and their jobs continue to be uniquely identifiable for import.\n\n==Importing documents and photos==\nImporting documents and photos is possible in both Employee and Applicant Management.\n\nTo import documents and photos, use the designated columns in the respective import template (Example: '''Person.Foto''' or '''Bewerbung.DokumentLebenslauf''', as shown in Figure 6). <br>\nThe import templates can be expanded as needed with other variables (from “Bewerbung.DokumentWeiteres2” to “Bewerbung.DokumentWeiteres14”). <br>\nSave all documents that you would like to upload into the solution into a folder as per Figure 7, and convert it into a ZIP archive folder. It is important that the folder structure is laid out schematically, i.e. the folder names are identical to the variables and the document names are identical to the entry in the cell for the respective variable in the template. Proceed as follows:\n\n#Create a folder with the same name as the variable in the import template (e.g. a variable in the template is called “Person.Foto” -> the name of the folder is identical and with '''square brackets''', i.e. [Person.Foto]) and add all similar documents to be imported into this folder.\n#Then fill in the corresponding column for each person with the associated document name (as shown in Figure 7, e.g. for Brad Pitt, enter “Foto_Brad_Pitt.jpg” for the “Person.Foto” variable).\n#If you would like to import additional documents (e.g. for the Bewerbung.DokumentLebenslauf variable), simply repeat the procedure above.\n#Once you have created all folders in this way, join them into a single ZIP-compressed folder. You can choose any name you like for the ZIP folder.\n# Next, navigate to the associated import window in the solution; there, you will not only select the completed template for the import, but also upload the ZIP file you have just created.\n# The import can now be run as usual.<br>\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] In order for the import to work smoothly, you may need to rewrite umlauts (ä,ö,ü) or letters with accents (e.g. Á or Å) in the document names in ae, oe, ue or A. When exporting documents from a legacy system, for example, these letters are often output as HTML codes in the document name. In order to import these again, it may be necessary to make transcriptions.<br>\n<br>\n[[File:Import Example Excel.PNG|thumb|none|700px|Fig. 6: Excel structure when importing variables]]\n<br>\n[[File:Grafik Ordnerprozess neu.JPG|thumb|none|540px|Fig. 7: Folder structure of the ZIP file]] \n<br>\n\n'''Notes''':<br>\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] A few requirements for the ZIP archive folder:\n* The ZIP archive must be created as a ''.zip'' file (e.g. the''.rar'' format will not work)\n* The ZIP archive may not be larger than '''125 MB'''.\n* Tip for creating the ZIP folder: Select the desired variables folder, right-click and select “Send to”, then click on “Compressed (zipped) folder”. This creates the ZIP folder automatically.\n<br>\n\n==Common log file errors — Tips & tricks==\nIf an import appears to be incomplete, check the log file stored in the solution for errors. Open it directly in your browser. Then search for the word “Error” in the log file to identify the source of the error. The list below can help you in this process.\n<br><br>\n* '''Login already exists:'''\n[[File:Login-Error.PNG|thumb|right|600px|Fig. 8: Login name already assigned]]\n: If the log file shows this error, it means that the login is already saved in the solution. It could be the same person with a different user ID.\n<br><br><br><br>\n* '''Value does not exist in selection list XY:'''\n[[File:Auswahlliste-Error.PNG|thumb|right|600px|Fig. 9: Value does not exist in selection list]]\n: This error message indicates that the given entry does not exist in the selection list stored in your Umantis solution. Accordingly, you need to make adjustments to the list in the solution, or modify the entry and then re-start the import.\n<br><br>\n* '''Organizational unit does not exist:'''\n[[File:OE-Error.PNG|thumb|right|600px|Fig. 10: Organizational unit not found]]\n: This error indicates that an organizational unit is missing. Supplement the selection list in the solution or change your entry of the organizational unit.\n<br><br><br><br>\n* '''Value is missing in a fixed list:'''\n[[File:Fixe Liste-Error.PNG|thumb|right|600px|Fig. 11: Fixed list does not contain value]]\n: The entry to be imported is not part of the fixed list. Adjust the entry in the import file so that it corresponds to the entries of the fixed lists in the solution.\n<br><br><br><br>\n* '''Incorrect XML structure:'''\n[[File:Parser-Error.PNG|thumb|right|600px|Fig. 12: Parser error due to incorrect XML structure]]\n: The “parser error” means that the XML contains errors, and that the import therefore cannot be performed. In the example shown here, for instance, the closing tag </Record>(PARAMID-LOOP-END) is missing.</Category></Import>\n<br>\n\n==Other error messages during import==\n\nThis is a list of error messages that may occur during import: \n* '''Parser error:''' ''opening and ending tag mismatch''\n: Reason: Field end missing \n\n* '''OU not found:''' ''ERROR: SearchValue: ID not found in list 66 of customer CUSTOMERID''\n: Reason: OU not available in list 66\n\n* '''List:''' ''ERROR: SearchValue: ID not found in list 12 of customer CUSTOMERID''\n: Reason: Selection list value missing\n\n* '''Fixed lists:''' ''ERROR: Matching code (fixed lists) could not be found...''\n: Reason: Incorrect value -> fixed list\n\n* '''Login:''' ''Error setting login name ...

This regulation has been in force since May 2016. The deadline for implementing this regulation falls on May 25, 2018; after that date, companies must ensure that they are in compliance with its provisions.\n\nThis page presents all the important information relating to the Haufe applications [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]] and [[Employee management|Employee Management]] in this regard. \n\n[[File:GDPR.png|50px]] Several different pages in our Online Help refer to the General Data Protection Regulation. These sections contain either functional descriptions or further information relating to the General Data Protection Regulation, and are marked with the “GDPR” icon (''General Data Protection Regulation''). \n\n__TOC__\n\n===Scope of application===\nThe General Data Protection Regulation applies to all EU member states.\n\n===Compliance and responsibility===\nThe Haufe applications (Applicant Management and Employee Management) will offer all the necessary functionalities to configure the solution for GDPR compliance no later than the deadline for implementation of the GDPR (May 25, 2018). Compliance with the relevant legal provisions can only be ensured by the customer, i.e.: '''It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the solution is correctly configured in accordance with the new regulations.''' Haufe provides the underlying functional capabilities and provides all the necessary configuration options. Solutions are configured by each individual customer (provided that they have the necessary user role) in accordance with locally applicable law.\n\n===[[File:attention.gif]] Important notes===\nPlease take note of the following guidelines, implement them in consultation with your company's data protection officer, and ensure compliance with them in the long term:\n\n'''As a company, you must ensure that the following rights are protected at all times for the affected parties:''' \n:* the right to information,\n:* the right to rectification,\n:* the right to deletion / right to be forgotten,\n:* the right to restrict processing,\n:* the right of objection and\n:* the right to data portability.\n'''In accordance with Art. 6 EU GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful if:''' \n:* the data subject has given their consent,\n:* the data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract,\n:* the data processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation,\n:* the processing is necessary to protect legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, or\n:* another exception mentioned in the regulation applies.\n[[File:checkmark.gif]] '''Please note that as the person responsible for the processing of personal data, you must confirm which of these justifications you are invoking. This could be either the execution of the employment contract or direct consent from the employee.'''\n\n* Please note that (in Germany, for example) each company’s works council generally has to approve the legality of using [[Reports|analyses/reports]] that contain personally-identifiable data.\n* The Haufe application offers various configuration options. Among other things, specific free-text fields can be defined independently by the customer, or renamings can be configured. The responsibility for these configurations lies with the customer, and should be reviewed for conformity with the GDPR. We recommend that you only make changes of this type if they do not lead to the storage of personally-identifiable data.\n* [[#Compliance and responsibility|Compliance and responsibility]]\n\n===GDPR requirements and implementation in Haufe===\nThe following table provides helpful information about <u>relevant</u> requirements from the General Data Protection Regulation, and how each of them is implemented in Haufe Applicant Management (AM) and Employee Management (EM). \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Requirement\n! Implementation\n! Notes\n|-\n| ''It must be checked whether information about a person’s racial origin can be assigned to them in the system.''\n| These data require special protection, and such protection is provided by Haufe [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]]. The responsible customer administrator will find a legal notice in the application process settings for each branch office (''/Administration/Agency/[ID]/Profile/ApplicationProcessConfiguration''). From here, he or she can activate the required questions ([[Dynamic questions#EEOC Questions|EEOC questions]]) if required by applicable law (e.g. in the United States of America). \n|\n* Review your local data privacy laws and activate these questions (EEOC questions) only if legally required (e.g. in the United States, where these questions are relevant to the application process).\n* If you activate the EEOC questions for branch offices outside the United States, please make sure that collecting this data does not violate local data privacy laws.\n* The data is stored at the application level, not at the level of the individual person. \n* Free-text fields or renaming of fields are the responsibility of the customer.\n|-\n| ''It should be possible to restrict access to personal data.''\n| '''Applicant Management''' Access to application documents can be blocked with a corresponding [[Application documents#Actions|action]]. This prevents read and write access for everyone with access permissions (except for administrators). \n'''Employee management:''' Access to a person profile can be blocked with the corresponding action in the [[Settings in employee file#Actions|settings in the employee file]]. This prevents read and write access to the person profile (except for administrators) on all profile views. \n| When you execute the “Block access to person” action (in either Applicant or Employee Management), a confirmation dialog box is displayed. Click “Block access” to complete the action. This action can be undone by the administrator at any time. \n; Related documentation:\n'''AM:'''\n* [[Application documents#Actions|Application documents > Block access to person]]\n'''EM:'''\n* [[Employee file#Actions|Employee file > Settings > Block access to person]]\n|-\n| ''There should be an appropriate function for applicants and employees/former employees to delete their personal data (by legitimate request).''\n| Delete functions are provided for: \n* [[Application documents#Deleting an application|Applications]]\n* [[Job subscribers|Job alert subscribers]]\n* [[Vacancies|Jobs]] (through the individual job profile)\n* [[People directory|External individuals]]\nIf an applicant deletes their profile in Applicant Management, it will automatically be displayed for the HR expert/administrator with the following message: “This applicant has marked their profile for deletion.” It then falls to the responsible HR expert or administrator to completely delete the profile.

This consent can be revoked by the applicant in his or her [[Access for applicant|profile]]. Applicants also see a link to the privacy policy statement for the specific branch office in (each of) their application(s).\n\nIn Haufe '''Employee Management''', external individuals (event participants) can indicate when registering whether they agree to the privacy policy statement and consent to the release of their data (default text for data release consent: ''Yes, I agree that my data may be saved even after the end of my specific participation, and that I may be informed of other interesting offers.'') This consent can be revoked by the external individual in his or her [[Access as an external person|profile]].  \n\n''For Haufe solutions in which this extension is not yet available (standalone environments), the data release consent and the agreement to the privacy policy statement should be implemented with additional, manually configured [[Selection lists|selection lists]].'' \n| \n; Related documentation:\n'''AM:'''\n* [[Data protection policy & data release|Data protection policy & data release]]\n* [[Access for applicant|Applicant access]]\n* [[Applicant management main page|Applicant Management home]]\n* [[Application documents|Application file]]\n'''EM:'''\n* [[Data protection policy & data release|Data protection policy & data release]]\n* [[Access as an external person|Access as an external individual]]\n* [[Employee Management home page|Employee Management home page]]\n|-\n| ''Fields must be appropriately marked as optional or required.''\n| In both Haufe Applicant Management and Employee Management, user input fields can be marked as required fields.

We recommend that you review this list with your company’s data protection officer, since you are responsible for configuring your Haufe solution in accordance with all applicable data privacy regulations. \n\n# Please take note of the information provided under [[#Konformität und Verantwortung|Compliance and responsibility]], as well as the [[# Wichtige Hinweise|notes]].\n# Check that your privacy policy rules are up to date. \n# '''Privacy policy statement:''' <br>Check the settings for the [[Data protection policy & data release|privacy policy statement & data release]].\n# '''EEOC questions:''' (Applicant Management) <br> Activate these questions ([[Dynamic questions#EEOC Questions|EEOC questions]]) only if legally required (e.g. in the United States, where these questions are relevant to the application process). <br> Check this under: ''Settings > Branch offices > Select branch office > Settings tab > Application process configuration''\n# Enable '''Block access to person''': <br> Check whether the links for “''Block access to person''” are [[Configuration mode|displayed]], so that they can be used if needed: \n#* Applicant Management: [[Application documents|Application documents]]\n#* Employee management: [[Settings in employee file#Actions|Employee file]] \n# '''Data release settings:''' \n#; Applicant Management\n#* Enable the “Data release” container for display on the [[Applicant management main page|home page]]. \n#: [[File:info.gif]] This container includes important [[Search functions#Advanced search for data release settings/decisions|search links]] and helps the people in charge of data privacy policy to keep track of the relevant settings.\n#* Check whether the data release settings are enabled for display in the [[Access for applicant|Access for applicants]]. \n#; Employee management \n#* Enable the “Data release” container for display on the [[Employee Management home page|home page]]. \n#: [[File:info.gif]] This container includes important [[Search functions#Advanced search for data release settings/decisions|search links]] and helps the people in charge of data privacy policy to keep track of the relevant settings.\n#* Check whether the data release settings are enabled for display to [[Access as an external person|External individuals]]. \n#: [[File:attention.gif]] '''Important note for standalone solutions''': ''For Haufe solutions in which this extension is not yet available (standalone environments), the data release consent and the agreement to the privacy policy statement should be implemented with additional, manually configured [[Selection lists|selection lists]]. For more information, see the section on:'' '''[[#Einstellungen zur Datenfreigabe über manuell konfigurierte Auswahllisten|Settings for data release via manually-configured selection lists]]'''\n#* In general, it is recommended that you obtain the employee's consent to the release of their data as part of their employment contract. If you want to get your employees’ data release consent through Haufe Employee Management, you can do this by using manually-configured selection lists, as described in the [[#Einstellungen zur Datenfreigabe über manuell konfigurierte Auswahllisten|lower section]] (paragraph on “''Displaying in person profile''”). \n# '''Search functions''' <br> The search functions provided in Haufe help you to search on the [[Search functions#Advanced search for data release settings/decisions|data release settings]] of applicants or external individuals/event participants. Check whether these search filters are displayed in the [[Search functions#Advanced Search|advanced search]] area.\n# '''Clarity and sustainability:''' \n#* Ensure that your data protection officer (or other responsible person) performs a final review of all settings that are relevant for your company. \n#* Raise awareness within your company about processes relating to data protection by talking with all relevant personnel (managers, employees, HR experts, etc.) about the GDPR and the associated requirements. \n#* Make sure that your Haufe solution is configured to ensure sustainable GDPR compliance (if required), and that no subsequent processes conflict with this configuration.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Please note:''' Each individual company is responsible for its own compliance with the GDPR. Haufe provides GDPR information to its customers as a service. However, this information does not constitute legal advice. Each company must take responsibility for its own implementation of and compliance with the requirements of the GDPR.\n\n===Settings for data release via manually-configured selection lists===\n; [[File:Configuration Needed.png|50px]] Configure selection list and make it available (Employee Management)\n''[[File:info.gif]] The following configuration is only necessary for Haufe applications with a version older than 23.1.0.0 (standalone solutions).

The following is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to configure this list and make it available.\n\n====Configure selection list====\n# Log in to your Haufe Employee Management solution as an [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|administrator]]. \n# Navigate to the [[Selection lists|selection lists]] via: ''Settings > Main settings >'' ''Selection lists'' tab <br>(or alternatively, with the ''/Administration/Dropdown'' URL extension). \n# In the “Employee profile” section, search for a selection list that has not yet been used <br>(in the following example: '''''Personal data user-defined List 24''''') and click on [[File:Edit.GIF|20px]].\n# You are now in the view for this selection list. Under “Actions”, click on '''''+Add selection value'''''.\n# Now enter the first selection list value with the text to approve the data release (in German and English in this example):\n#* ''Ja, ich bin damit einverstanden, dass meine Daten auch über eine konkrete Teilnahme hinaus gespeichert werden und ich auf weitere interessante Angebote hingewiesen werden kann.''\n#* ''Yes, I agree that my data may be saved even after the end of my specific participation, and that I may be informed of other interesting offers.'' \n# Save your changes. \n# Click '''''+ Add selection value''''' again to create the second selection value with the text to decline the data release:\n#* ''Nein, ich möchte, dass meine Daten nach den aktuellen Teilnahmen gelöscht werden''\n#* ''No, I want my data to be deleted after my current participations are completed.''\n# Save your changes.\n: You have successfully configured the selection list: <br>[[File:Auswahlliste_24_DE.png|500px|border]] \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Notes:''' \n* Do not enter a “Meta-information” or “Parent category” value for the newly created selection values; leave them blank.\n* The texts for consent and refusal of consent are merely examples. You should decide on the exact wording of these selection values in consultation with your company's data protection officer.\n\n====Integrate selection list / make it available====\nOnce the selection list is configured, you must integrate it into the relevant forms/screens. To do this, follow the steps below:\n=====Displaying in the registration form for external individuals=====\n[[File:attention.gif]] To enable this field for display in registration forms, you need a published event for which you then register as an external individual: \n# '''Stay logged in as an [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|administrator]]''' in your normal browser session. \n# Open an '''additional private browser window''' or “incognito” window. \n# In this incognito window, open the '''Event overview''' for your Haufe Employee Management solution and click on “''I want to register for this event''” next to a '''published event'''. \n# The '''registration form''' will now be displayed. Copy this URL (which is based on the following pattern:''<nowiki>https://employeeapp-CUSTOMER-ID.umantis.com/Public/Courses/ID/Profile/RegisterAsExternal/NextTargetID/ID</nowiki>'') and paste it into your “normal” (non-incognito) browser session, where you are still logged in as an administrator. \n# In [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], scroll down to the '''''Personal data user-defined List 24''''' field and click on [[File:Config.gif]]. <br> There, set the following settings: \n#* '''Visibility:''' Uncheck the box to display this field.\n#* '''Original content label''' (names): Enter the name for each [[Languages|language]] you use, e.g. for \n#: German: '''''Datenfreigabe''''' and \n#: English: '''''Data release'''''.\n#* '''Type of input field:''' Select '''''SingleSelect RadioButton''''' so that only a single radio button selection is allowed. \n#* '''Error correction during entry:''' Select '''''must'''''. This makes it '''mandatory''' for the external individual to indicate whether they agree to the data release or not.\n# Save your settings. The following new field is now displayed with two selection values: <br> [[File:Container_Data_Release_Profile_DE.png|500px|border]]\n# Exit configuration mode and follow the rest of the instructions.\n\n=====Displaying in person profile=====\n# Enter the URL extension ''/MyPublic/Profile/Personal'' to access the profile view. \n# In [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], scroll down to the '''''Personal data user-defined List 24''''' field and click on [[File:Config.gif]]. <br> There, set the following settings: \n#* '''Visibility:''' Uncheck the box to display this field.\n#* '''Original content label''' (names): Enter the name for each [[Languages|language]] you use, e.g. for \n#: German: '''''Datenfreigabe''''' and \n#: English: '''''Data release'''''.\n#* '''Type of input field:''' Select '''''SingleSelect RadioButton''''' so that only a single radio button selection is allowed. \n# Save your settings. The following new field is now displayed with two selection values: <br> [[File:Container_Data_Release_Profile_DE.png|500px|border]]\n\nYou have successfully configured the data release settings using a selection list. \n\n====Search by data release settings====\n[[File:info.gif]] Observe the following guidelines to enable internal search for external individuals and the corresponding data release settings: \n# Navigate to the [[People directory|people directory]] through ''Employees > people directory'' (or alternatively, by directly using the URL extension ''/ExternalParticipants'')\n# Start [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] and then click on “[[Search functions#Advanced Search|Advanced search]]”. \n# Scroll down to the '''''Personal data user-defined List 24''''' field and click on [[File:Config.gif]]. <br> There, set the following settings: \n#* '''Visibility:''' Uncheck the box to display this field.\n#* '''Original content label''' (names): Enter the name for each [[Languages|language]] you use, e.g. for \n#: German: '''''Datenfreigabe''''' and \n#: English: '''''Data release'''''.\n#* '''Type of input field:''' You can leave this setting set to '''''default'''''.

Please note that SECO always provides the latest list shortly before the end of the year. Only then can the update of the list be scheduled and carried out within Umantis solutions (via an update). \n\nFollow the steps below to manually update the Dynamic List ID 11:\n* Log in to your Umantis Applicant Management solution as an administrator.\n* Navigate to the '''Imports''' (''/Import'') and select the option: '''Import Selection Lists''' under \"Actions\". (''/Import/NewLists'')\n\n* In this import view, make the following specifications: \n:* '''Title''' \n::(Choose a meaningful title, e.g. \"RAV/SECO-List 202x\")  \n:* '''File*''' \n:: Upload the following Excel file: [[Media:Listeneinträge AVAM 2022.xls|Listeneinträge_AVAM_2022.xls]]\n:* '''Import Type*''' \n:: Please select the first entry:\"'''''EXCEL Import: Import Selection Lists (Complete Import)'''''\" \n:* Click \"'''Start Import'''' and refresh the page after a while to see the import status. \n\n\n[[File:info.gif]] After successful import, you will see the new entries of Dynamic List 11 \"RAV Employment Code\" at '''''/Administration/Dropdown/11/Profile'''''. Via \"Actions\" you have the possibility to \"View the deleted entries of this list\" (''/Administration/Dropdown/11/ToBeDeleted'').\n\n==Help with the job reporting requirement in Umantis Applicant Management==\n\n===Prerequisites===\nTo be able to forward a job to the RAV job board, you must first have a customer ID and login data. You should contact the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) directly to get live login data. You should ensure that you email all the details required so that the processing time at SECO is not lengthened unnecessarily.  \n''(compare to [http://test-api.job-room.ch/api-docs/jobAdvertisements/v1/index.html])''\n\n[[File:info.gif]] <span style=\"background:lightyellow\"> Click the link below to open the relevant email template: [mailto:jobroom-api@seco.admin.ch?subject=Job-Room%20API%20access&body=Name%20des%20Unternehmens%20%2F%20Company%20name%3A%20%0AAdresse%20%2F%20Address%3A%20%0AE-Mail-Adresse%20%2F%20Email%20address%3A%20%0A%0ATechnische(r)%20Ansprechpartner%20%2F%20Technical%20contact%20person%3A%20%20%20%0AE-Mail-Adresse%20%2F%20Email%20address%3A%20%0ATelefonnummer%20%2F%20Telephone%20number%3A%20%0ABenutzername%20%2F%20User%20name%3A%20%0A%0ADas%20zu%20erwartende%20Volumen%20der%20Stellenanmeldungen%20betr%C3%A4gt%20%2F%20The%20expected%20volume%20of%20job%20registration%20is%3A E-Mail erstellen]</span>\n\nThe link opens a new email message with fields that you have to fill in.

With these expandable elements, you can now define your customized view of the applicant file and display certain information only when needed. Hovering the mouse pointer over the applicant's photo now causes a tooltip to appear with the most important information on that applicant.

How many entries are displayed here will depend on your filter settings. \n\nIf you have opened an application or a job, it will be highlighted in gray in the switch bar. This makes it easier for you to compare and navigate to other applicants and jobs. The sidebars / candidate and job switchers can be collapsed and expanded.\n\nPlease note that the display of the candidate switcher entries is limited to a maximum of 25 records. This restriction only affects the candidate switcher.\n\n==Tooltips==\nCertain information which was stored in the table columns is now shown in tooltips to enhance a better overview.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Using [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] you can use [[File:config.gif]] to specify whether this information should be displayed in the tooltip for that field: \n* '''Show the content (mouseover tooltip):'''\n:O default\n:O show in tooltip upon mouseover hover\n:O show directly\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px\"> '''[[File:info.gif]] The following fields are shown in the tooltip by default:''' <br> ''Click on “Expand” to show the table.'' <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

On August 15, 2018, the German federal cabinet therefore approved a draft bill to modify the Civil Status Act (Personenstandsgesetz) to allow the term “various” to be entered in the gender field.''\n\nThis page presents all the important information relating to the Umantis applications [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]] and [[Employee management|Employee Management]] in this regard. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:divers.png|30px]]\n| Several pages in our Online Help refer to gender. These sections contain either settings or additional information relating to the third gender. They are marked with the “Various” icon.\n|}\n\n__TOC__\n\n===Scope of application===\nThe gender value “Various” must be made available in Germany starting in 2019, in accordance with the modification to the Civil Status Act (Personenstandsgesetz). The legal existence of an unspecified gender value is also recognized by other states. \n\n===Compliance and responsibility===\nWith the release of version 2018.2.5.0 on 12/18/2018, Umantis applications (Applicant Management and Employee Management) now offer the relevant settings and functionalities to allow solutions to be configured in accordance with the ''Modification to the German Civil Status Act (Personenstandsgesetz)''. Compliance with the relevant legal provisions can only be ensured by the customer, i.e.: '''It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the solution is correctly configured in accordance with the new regulations.''' Umantis provides the underlying functional capabilities and provides the necessary configuration options. Solutions are configured by each individual customer (provided that they have the necessary user role) in accordance with locally applicable law.\n\n===Settings in Umantis Applicant Management===\n====List for Title field====\nDefine the “List of titles” under ''Branch offices > [[Branches#Other specific settings|Other specific settings]]''\n\nHere you can specify which title options should be provided for users and applicants to select from. The default options are Ms. and Mr. Add the “Various” selection value if you want to provide the third gender option.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please take note of the information in the [[#Variablen|Variables]] section as well, and modify the associated emails and templates.\n\n===Settings in Umantis Employee Management===\n====List for Title field====\nDefine the “List of titles” under ''Settings > Company profile > [[Settings for company / organization profile|“Local settings” section / List of titles]]''\n\nHere you can specify which title options should be provided for users to select from. The default options are Ms. and Mr. Add the “Various” selection value if you want to provide the third gender option.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please take note of the information in the [[#Variablen|Variables]] section as well, and modify the associated emails and templates.\n\n===Variables===\nThe following [[Variables|variables]] are currently used for titles in emails:''[Empfaenger.Anrede.Formell] [Empfaenger.Name]'' \n\nTo use the third gender option correctly in email communications, one of the new variables should be used instead: \n* ''[Empfaenger.AnredeNameFormell]'', \n* ''[Empfaenger.AnredeNameKomplettFormell]'' or \n* ''[Empfaenger.AnredeNameInformell]''\n\n\nAssuming the following example names and titles for each gender (German examples shown):\n* Male: Mr. Dr. Stephan Schmidt\n* Female: Ms. Prof. Dr. Barbara Schmidt\n* Various: Dr. Adrian Müller\n\nThe following example shows the title that will be used for each variable for each gender:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#c0c0c0;\" | Variable\n! style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#c0c0c0;\" | Gender\n! style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#c0c0c0;\" | Results in the following title + name combination\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [Empfaenger.AnredeNameFormell]\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Male\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Dear Mr. Schmidt \n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864;\" | Female\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864;\" | Dear Ms. Schmidt\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7; color:#333333;\" | Various\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7; color:#333333;\" | Dear Adrian Müller\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [Empfaenger.AnredeNameKomplettFormell]\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Male\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Dear Mr. Dr. Schmidt\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864;\" | Female\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864;\" | Dear Ms. Prof. Dr. Schmidt\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7; color:#333333;\" | Various\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7; color:#333333;\" | Dear Dr. Adrian Müller\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | [Empfaenger.AnredeNameInformell]\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Male\n| style=\"background-color:#00d2cb;\" | Dear Stephan (= male-specific form)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864; color:#333333;\" | Female\n| style=\"background-color:#fd6864; color:#333333;\" | Dear Barbara (= female-specific form)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7;\" | Various\n| style=\"background-color:#ffffc7;\" | Dear Adrian (= gender-neutral form)\n|}"

In this version, there is no content language parameter in the overview, and all published jobs are shown, regardless of language. If a given job has been published in 4 languages, however, then it will only appear once (i.e. there is a certain degree of intelligence).<br> Depending on the user language (or if the user is not logged in, depending on the requested environment langu-age), the page will attempt to show all job postings in the best/most appropriate language for the user from the ones in which the given job was published. Once the user clicks on a job here, everything goes back to the way it was, because the user will see the job posting in one specific language. Everything works exactly the same as in a job posting that is accessed via /Jobs/'''2''', for example. The system does not make a distinction between users coming from /Jobs/'''All''' and those coming from /Jobs/'''2'''.\n: Therefore, when customizing the [[Welcome and job subscription email|welcome email]], it is not recommended that you use both variants (/Jobs/All and /Jobs/2 etc.).

Your own Umantis instance must also be registered as a third-party system, if users want to be able to switch to other user profiles within the same Umantis system (labeled in the system as “new third-party system (Applicant Management)” or “new third-party system (Employee Management)”).\n\nTo register third-party systems, use the links (“Register third-party system”) in the [[Interfaces|Interfaces]] section. For Umantis systems, the information that will be needed later for Single Sign On is gathered from the system immediately, and the link is later created automatically. The relevant fields are:\n* '''Name:''' Choose any meaningful name for the third-party system (e.g. umantis Applicant Management) \n* '''System no.:''' ID of the solution (example: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''1234'''.umantis.com or <nowiki>https://employeeapp-</nowiki>'''1234.de'''.umantis.com) \n*: [[File:Info.gif]] For standalone customers, “DEFAULT” must be entered here. \n* '''Authentication key:''' Corresponds to the key that is entered in the third-party system as the ''Authentication key for SSO (Single Sign-On)'' . Otherwise the configuration will not work.\n* '''URL:''' If the third-party system does not use the same domain as umantis (\"umantis.com\"), the URL must be specifically indicated here.\n\nFor other third-party systems, the corresponding request can be written directly in HTML. You can use parameters here ([ParamID1] to [ParamID5]), which can then be copied into the request in a user-specific way.\nDepending on the system, other relevant information may need to be entered for [[SSO - Single Sign On|Single Sign On]].\n\nFor each user ([[Settings in employee file|Settings]]), access to other user profiles in the registered third-party systems can then be specified.<br>\nThe following fields are relevant here:\n* '''Name:''' Choose any meaningful name\n* '''User ID:''' User key from the target user profile (if one exists); otherwise, the user number should be entered.\n* '''Source system key:''' Issued only when setting up a new third-party system, and therefore no longer retrieved afterwards (although it can be viewed and changed in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]]); if a source system key is specified for the target user, then it should match the one in this field.\n* '''Home page''': For HR and administrators,\"/\" should always be entered here; when changing departments, \"SelfServiceLine\" should be entered.\n* '''Third-party system''': Once registered, third-party systems are automatically available for selection via dropdown menu in the organization settings. Select the third-party system you want to work with.\n\n[[File:info.gif‎]] Note that the configuration must be done on both of the profiles that you want to be able to switch between!\n\n'''Application'''<br>\nOnce a user has been provided with at least one access to another user profile, the user will see the \"change user\" icon [[File:Switch.gif‎]] in the top navigation bar.\n\nBy clicking on this icon, the user can then see links to all their available accesses, and can change to any of them.\n\n==Related topics==\n[[File:info.gif]] An overview of all articles relating to interfaces can be found in the category: [https://de.onlinehelp.umantis.com/index.php/Category:Schnittstellen Interfaces]\n\n* [[Video interview - Interview suite by viasto|Video interview — Interview suite by viasto]] \n* [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]] \n* [[XING|Xing]] \n* [[CV Parsing|CV parsing]] \n* [[Job boards|Job boards]] \n* [[Job board provider|Job board providers]] \n* [[Aconso - Digital personnel file|aconso]]"

Only then is the link redirected to “/Password/PasswordSetNew”. When the system email is set up with “.com/?”, the IP restriction on “/” applies, and enabling “/Password” has no effect. Result: The user receives a 403 error message when setting their password.\n\n: '''Solution:''' Modify the link in the system email \n:* Directly add the following extension before the URL parameter: “Password/PasswordSetNew” (https://[Special.Hostname]/'''Password/PasswordSetNew'''?PasswordResetToken=[Password.Token]&PersID=[Empfaenger.ID]&customer=[Special.Customer]&lang=eng&DesignID=[Design.ID])\n\n[[File:IP Range Beispiele.png|thumb|left|800px|Fig. 2: IP range: Enabling and restricting URLs]]\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n==Range==\nIn the '''IP Range''' field, you can specify a single IP address or a range of IP addresses.\n\nEntry format (single address):\n192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.*, 192.168.*, etc.\n \nEntry format (range):\n192.168.1.1-192.168.1.8, 192.*-193.*, etc.\n\nIdeally, a separate entry should be created for each IP or IP range.

For '''Prospective Media''' (PMS), on the other hand, publication texts and options for a job are not managed within Umantis, but on the third-party platform itself. The way the publication process works is that HR experts use the links associated with the job to navigate to the corresponding third-party platform, where they can then manage the publication text and all other publication options. They then select the desired media, and put the job posting online for each of those channels.\n* All publication platforms allow the Umantis job board to be used as a publication medium too, so that the publication texts are fed into the corresponding job in Umantis, and the ''Publication on home page'' is initiated through the publication platform. The link to the application form for the job in Umantis is always sent along too.\n\n==Umantis applicant management==\nUmantis Applicant Management offers an interface of its own through which other instances of Umantis Applicant Management can actively publish their jobs. In this case, administration of the job posting texts is the responsibility of the sender system, and job postings are published 1:1 in the selected language and specified area (home page or intranet).\n\n===Settings in Umantis===\nThe following fields must be filled out in the “sending” Umantis Applicant Management solution in order to use the “receiving” Umantis Applicant Management solution as a job board provider:\n\n* '''URL:''' The URL to which publication requests are directed (e.g. <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-1067.umantis.com</nowiki>). As such, this URL is the actual job board on which you will find the published jobs after successfully linking the two Umantis Applicant Management solutions. \n* '''Branch office ID in third-party system:''' Umantis ID of the branch office for which the job should be created in the third-party system, and which should be used for the branch office-specific job positing.\n* '''User system ID in third-party system:''' The user’s Umantis ID in the third-party system, i.e. in the Umantis Applicant Management solution that is being used as a job board (see under '''URL'''). Publication will go through this ID. The ID in question can be found in the URL of the user’s profile (e.g. <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-1067.umantis.com</nowiki>/Administration/Users/'''ID'''/Profile).\n* '''Authentication key for third-party system:''' To verify the interface, the two Umantis Applicant Management solution instances exchange keys with each other. Enter the same key here that was entered in the \"Authentication key for publication from third-party system\" field of the [[Settings for company / organization profile|Settings for company / organizational profile]] in the target solution (see under '''URL''').\n* '''Job posting layout code for publication on third-party system:''' In the target system, you can automatically activate a particular [[Advertisement layouts|job posting layout]] for publication. This setting is optional — and if you have previously selected other job posting layouts for individual jobs, it is superfluous. In that case, the code for that layout will be sent, overriding this setting.\n\nOnce you have correctly filled out the fields, you can publish the job via [[Internal publication (applicant management)|Internal job posting]] > '''umantis Applicant Management home page (third-party system)'''. \n\n'''Note:'''<br>\n*You must ensure that the link for the application form points directly to the source Applicant Management instance for each job posting.\n*The application link is sent to the target solution each time the interface is triggered, and can be pulled from the \"Text block 6\" field of the corresponding publication by using the [[Variables|template variable]] [Inserat.Text6].\n\n==Prospective Media (PMS)==\nIn contrast to job postings on job boards, job posting texts and publication options for a given job on ''Prospective Media'' are not managed within Umantis, but on the third-party platform itself. The way the publication process works is that HR experts use the links associated with the job to navigate to the corresponding third-party platform, where they can then manage the publication text and all other publication options. They then select the desired media, and put the job posting online for each of those channels. In addition, the Umantis job board can also be set up as a publication medium, so that the publication texts are fed into the corresponding jobs in Umantis, and the ''Publication on home page'' process is initiated through the publication platform. The link to the application form for the job in Umantis is always included here too.\n\n===Static vs. generic interface===\nYou can choose to use either the ''Static'' or the ''Generic'' interface.\nThe difference is that the Generic Interface allows you to send any job publication texts you like, whereas the Static Interface only allows you to send the fields for ''Job ID'', ''Job Title'', ''Applicant Link'' and ''Job Layouts Link''.\n\n* '''Static Interface:''' In the static version of the PMS interface, the range of data that can be sent is fixed, i.e. only the following data are permitted: ''Job ID'', ''Job Title'', ''Applicant Link'' and ''Job Layouts Link''. The advantage of this version is that there is no need to configure the interface, so it can be used immediately.<br>''Note:''<br>These data are sent using URL parameters, and the data that can be sent are therefore subject to a length restriction of 255 characters.\n\n* '''Generic Interface:''' With the generic approach, any job data you like can be sent to PMS. The data to be sent are extracted using Umantis variables, then placed in an XML structure.<br>''Note:''<br>The interface sends the data as HTTP POST arguments, so there are no length restrictions.\n<br>\n===Settings in Umantis===\n=====General settings=====\nThe following settings must be configured in the general settings in Umantis.\n\n* '''URL:''' The URL to which publication requests are directed. (The following URL is used by default: ''<nowiki>https://jobcenter.prospective.ch/NJCWeb/services/fastinterface</nowiki>''). The customer-specific URL is: ''[Customer].jobbooster.prospective.ch''\n\n* '''Customer ID in Prospective Media:''' Similar to the Customer ID in Umantis, each customer has a unique ID with ''Prospective Media''. This ID must be stored in Umantis, and is part of the authentication process when communicating data.<br>''Note:'' Please check with ''Prospective Media'' as to what Customer ID you should use here.\n\n* '''Prospective Media XML:''' With the <u>Generic Interface</u>, you can use an XML-structured document to specify the data that should be sent from Umantis to PMS for publication purposes. Its structure and content can be defined in accordance with the publication requirements. The job data for this XML are extracted using Umantis [[Variables|variables]].<br>''Note:'' Work with ''Prospective Media'' to develop a new XML that fulfills your requirements more effectively than the default XML for the interface.\n\n=====User-defined settings=====\nCertain settings must be set up for the individual users who are to be allowed to publish content from Umantis to PMS.\n* '''User security key:''' The security key is needed to authenticate the associated user.<br>''Note:'' You will receive the login information directly from ''Prospective Media''. The IDs of the Umantis users who are allowed to publish to PMS must also be entered in the ''Prospective Media'' system.\n\n===Settings in Prospective Media===\nThe following Umantis-specific settings must be entered in the ''Prospective Media'' system in order to use the interface:\n* '''User system ID:''' The Umantis ID of the users who are allowed to use the ''Prospective Media'' interface (i.e. to publish through ''Prospective Media'').\n\n* '''Customer ID in Umantis:''' Just as the ''Customer ID in Prospective Media'' must be entered in the Umantis settings, the Umantis Customer ID must also be entered in PMS. This is the same ID that you can find in the Umantis URL: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''[CustomerID]'''<nowiki>.umantis.com</nowiki>\n<br>\n\n===Additional information about Prospective Media (PMS)===\n* [[Technical implementation of the PMS interface|Technical implementation of the PMS interface]]\n<br>\n\n==Solique (Unio)==\nIn contrast to job postings on job boards, job posting texts and publication options for a given job on ''Solique'' (http://www.solique.ch) are not managed within Umantis, but on the third-party platform itself. The way the publication process works is that HR experts use the links associated with the job to navigate to the corresponding third-party platform, where they can then manage the publication text and all other publication options. They then select the desired media, and put the job posting online for each of those channels. In addition, the Umantis job board can be used as a publication medium too, so that the publication texts are fed into the corresponding job in Umantis, and the ''Publication on home page'' process is initiated through the publication platform. The link to the application form for the job in Umantis is always sent along too.\n\nYou can withdraw a job published on Solique directly through Umantis, with no need to go to the Solique site. Job postings should be published and withdrawn separately for each language.\n\n'''Note:'''<br>\n*Until recently, Solique was known as ''Unio''\n\n===Settings in Umantis===\nThe following settings must be configured in order to use ''Solique'':\n* '''Solique login:''' Login and password information are needed for authenticated publication through ''Solique''. You will receive the login information directly from ''Solique''.<br>\n* '''Solique password:''' Password and login information are needed for authenticated publication through ''Solique''. You will receive the login information directly from ''Solique''.<br>Click on the \"Change Solique password\" link and enter the password provided by Solique. The interface is then activated and ready for publications.\n* '''URL:''' The URL to which publication requests are directed (default is''<nowiki>http://www2.unio.ch/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UNUserInterface.woa/wa</nowiki>'').  Check with ''Solique'' about which target URLs your publication requests should point to when the system is in operation.\n* '''Solique XML:''' The XML document defines the structural requirements for the publication of jobs through ''Solique''. Its structure and content can be defined in accordance with the publication requirements. The job data are extracted using Umantis [[Variables|variables]].<br>Click on the “Customize Solique XML” link. Work with Solique to develop a new XML that fulfills your requirements more effectively than the default XML for the interface.<br>\n'''Note:'''<br>\n*You must make sure that the link for the application form points directly to the source AM instance for each publication.\n*To learn more about operations with ''Solique'' (Unio), please consult directly with our partner company.\n*The login name and password for ''Solique'' are stored at the user level. The same password should be used for Umantis and ''Solique''.\n\n==Publicitas==\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> [[File:info.gif]] Publicitas bankruptcy declaration (website announcement)<br> ''Click on “Expand” to show the contents.'' <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n\n''With the decision of the District Court of Bülach of May 11, 2018, Publicitas AG was declared bankrupt.

If you were using Publicitas, we recommend that you check the functionality of your current configuration. Due to the bankruptcy filing, we recommend that you use an alternative platform described on this page. \n\n(Internal documentation: https://wiki.abacus.ch/x/zQ9bD)\n\n==Broadbean==\nIn contrast to job board providers '''Unio''' and '''Prospective Media''', publication texts for ''Broadbean'' are created in Umantis and sent to ''Broadbean'' through the interface, where they are then prepared for publication to various media.\n\nAn overview of the job boards to which Broadbean can publish is available here: http://www.broadbean.com/job-boards/\n\n===Settings in Umantis===\nThe following settings must be configured in order to use ''Broadbean'': \n* '''Broadbean login:''' You will receive the login information directly from Broadbean.<br>\n* '''Broadbean password:''' Click on the \"Change Broadbean password\" link and enter the password provided by Broadbean. This will activate the interface immediately.\n* '''URL:''' The URL to which publication requests are directed (''<nowiki>default is https://api.adcourier.com/hybrid/hybrid.cgi</nowiki>''). Check with ''Broadbean'' about which target URLs your publication requests should point to when the system is in operation.\n* '''Broadbean publication XML:''' The XML document defines the structural requirements for the publication of jobs through ''Broadbean''.

Work with Broadbean to develop a new XML that fulfills your requirements more effectively than the default XML for the interface.<br> \n* '''Broadbean offline XML:''' Similar to the ''Broadbean publication XML'', you can specify an XML-structured document that can be used to explicitly withdraw a job from the Broadbean job board.\n\n* '''Broadbean CSS:''' The CSS document contains the style guidelines for the Broadbean interface. This document can be used to specify the appearance of the Broadbean forms embedded in the dialog window. If a CSS document is uploaded for use, the Broadbean publication XML must be modified accordingly. The stylesheet attribute must contain the path to the document. To ensure that the new design will be used, the following structure must be used for the CSS path in the Broadbean publication XML:'''<nowiki>https://<URL der Lösung>/[Broadbean.CSSFile]</nowiki>'''. The [Broadbean.CSSFile] variable contains the path to the CSS file.\n\n* '''One-to-one implementation:''' In order for Broadbean to re-use the job postings published in Umantis one-to-one, the job description created in Umantis should be sent to Broadbean as HTML. To do this, the following must be added to the unparsed publication XML after </JobDescription>: <VacExtension name='special_formatted_advert'>[Ausschreibung.HTML]</VacExtension>. You must make sure that the path in the job posting layout is not a relative path, but an '''absolute path'''. This means that all links and URLs in the templates must specify the full path. \n\n'''Note:'''<br>\n* You must make sure that the link for the application form points directly to the source AM instance for each publication.\n* To learn more about operations with ''Broadbean'' please consult directly with our partner company.\n* The login name and password for ''Broadbean'' are stored at the user level, and can be set up separately for each user.\n* A user will only see the option to publish a job through ''Broadbean''after appropriate login data have been specified.\n<br>\n\n'''Technical details:'''<br>\n\nUnder [[Technical details regarding Broadbean|Technical details regarding Broadbean]], you will find our default XML which lists the fields that we send to Broadbean.\n\n==Google4Jobs==\nGoogle for Jobs is a new Google feature that displays job postings directly on the first page of Google’s search results. To do this, Google aggregates information about job postings from all websites in the search index. What this means for job hunters is that, instead of having to search for relevant job openings on individual companies’ Careers pages or on job boards, they now simply have to enter the appropriate search terms in the Google search field. The most relevant hits are then shown in the results box, along with their source. Searches can be narrowed down further using various filter options, including work hours, industry, and publication date. Clicking on the selected job posting takes the user to the source page, where they can get more information about the job. \n\n===Settings in Google===\nBefore you publish a job for Google via Umantis Applicant Management, some settings must be made in Google and within your Umantis solution.\n\n====Create OAuth Client-ID====\n* Log in with your Google Account at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis. \n* Create a new project. \n* Select “Credentials” on the left and click on ''Create Credentials > '''OAuth Client ID'''''. Then follow the steps below: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| [[File:OAuthClientID.png|800px]]\n| '''1.''' Specify the '''Application type''' (Web application). <br>\n'''2.'''

Now you must carry out a '''verification''' to confirm ownership of the solution. \n\n* Open the following page https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home?hl=de <br> and click on “Add property”.\n* Customize the following URL according to your Umantis solution number and enter it as a property that you verify: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>''[YourSolutionNumber]''.''umantis.com/VacanciesGoogle4Jobs/''\n* After clicking “Next”, select the “HTML Tag” method, which you may find in the “Alternative Methods” tab\n: [[File:VerifMethod.png|400px]]\n* Copy the code from the meta tag (marked yellow in the screenshot) and paste it into the field '''Verifikationsschlüssel für Ihre Domain (Verification key for your domain)''' in your Umantis solution. Save these settings of your Umantis solution before you click “Verify” in Google. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] You can also use https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home for verification.\n\n====Indexing API====\nIn order to verify the owner of the URL to be indexed (when publishing jobs), the Google Indexing API is required. \n* Using Google's API library (https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library), find “Indexing API”.\n* Add it and select your solution under \"Credentials\".  \n* Add the following custom redirect URL under “Authorized redirect URls”: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>[YourSolutionNumber].umantis.com/callback/google4jobs''.\n* Click on “Save”.  \n\nNext, add the enabled “Indexing API” in the OAuth approval screen by: \n* Clicking \n* on ''Add scope'' in the “Scopes for Google APIs” section at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent, selecting the “Indexing API” and clicking on “Add”.\n* Save your settings. \n\nAfterwards, you can '''''publish the respective job''''' within your Umantis applicant management solution via the tab [[External vacancy notice|External posting]] (via “Google4Jobs”). Please note that you have to agree to the indexing by Google the first time you publish a job. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that it may take up to 24 hours before vacancies can be “captured” by Google (assuming the interface is successfully set up and the vacancy is advertised via Google4Jobs).\n\n=====Job not listed?=====\nYou can check whether you have filled in all the necessary fields to ensure that they can be found successfully by Google. \n* Click on the following link: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home\n* Under “URL prefix”, enter the following link, customized according to your solution number: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>[YourSolutionNumber].umantis.com/VacanciesGoogle4Jobs''\n* Check the following URL, customized according to your solution number and the job published via Google4Jobs: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>[YourSolutionNumber].umantis.com/VacanciesGoogle4Jobs/[ID]/Description/[ID]''\n* Then check the notes/information and configure your Umantis applicant management solution, where applicable.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] For more information, see: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289#url_cannot_be_on_google\n\n====Settings in Umantis Applicant Management====\n* '''API key''' \n: Enter the API key or the client ID here (provided via your Google Account, see above). \n* '''Secret key'''\n: Enter the secret key or the client key here (provided via your Google Account, see above). \n\n* '''Verification key for your domain'''\n: To verify that this is indeed your domain, Google needs access to an open page under your domain and will search there for an '''HTML MetaTag''' containing a certain (your) code.

See [[Publish vacancy|Publish job]] (publication channels) for more details.\n\nJob boards like ''Jobs.ch'' or ''Monster''provide a useful way to publish job postings through external publication channels. In Haufe Applicant Management, you can set up as many of these job boards as you like. A single job board can be used by multiple branch offices simultaneously for their publications, but only one publication language can be used for each platform. You can optionally specify a maximum publication period for a given job board, which limits how long a job posting can be published to that job board (the publication period is typically agreed on as part of the contract with the platform provider).<br> \n[[File:info.gif]] If no maximum publication period has been specified for a given job board, the job posting will automatically be withdrawn after 90 days.\n\n==Creating & editing job boards==\nUnder [[Settings|Settings]] > [[Interfaces|Interfaces]] > [[Job boards|Job boards]], you can set up new job boards or edit the entries for existing platforms.\n<br><br>\nThe following options are available in Haufe Applicant Management to publish job postings through job boards:\n\n===Email interface===\nThis publication channel can be used to email job postings directly to the appropriate job board, which then publishes them. Multiple attachments can also be included and sent with each email. The format of the email and its attachments (e.g. XML format) can be modified to meet the requirements of different individual job boards. Similarly to the activation email, you can define an email format that should be sent to the job board when withdrawing a job posting.<br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note:''' Only one email address is supported.\n\n===Web interface===\nWith this publication method, the jobs to be published are made available to the job board through a dedicated web interface. Job boards typically get direct access to an Internet address that you communicate to them in advance, from which they copy over information about the jobs you publish there. This process is also known in the industry as ''“crawling”'' or ''“spidering”'' . On this approach, you simply have to inform the job board of the relevant Internet address (URL).\n\nThe URL typically has the following structure:\n''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[YourID].umantis.com/XMLExport/[ID]?param1=[param1]&param_n=[param_n]</nowiki>''\n* '''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[YourID].umantis.com/XMLExport/[ID]?</nowiki>''': This part of the URL is fixed and cannot be changed.\n*'''[YourID]''': Your customer ID.\n*'''[ID]''': The export ID of the Automatic Export. This number is generated automatically by the system.\n*'''param1''' to '''param_n''': These parameters can be used to control data output (see ''Extracting and structuring job data with SQL and XSLT scripts''). Including these parameters is optional, and you can add as many of them as necessary.<br>\n\n''Example: “URL structure”:''<br>\n<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-133.umantis.com/XMLExport/106?PlattformID=98010&CustomerID=133</nowiki><br>\n\n====[[File:attention.gif]] Notes on modifying the request and “Apply” URLs in the SQL statement====\nIf these two URLs are entered in the SQL statement for a job board with the '''[CustomerID]''' placeholder (e.g. ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com</nowiki>''), this may cause the web interface to malfunction. In this case, follow the steps below to modify the SQL statement: \n# Navigate to your job boards (''/Administration/JobPlattforms/PlattformsDynamic''). \n# Find the job board you are using and click on [[File:edit.GIF]]\n# In the General Settings for the job board, click on the link to “Edit web interface”.\n# In the “SQL statement” sections, search for “[CustomerID]”\n#* The following expressions are <span style=\"color:blue\">correct/valid</span>: ''<nowiki>'https://recruitingapp-'</nowiki>'''''|| '[CustomerID]' ||'''''<nowiki>'.umantis.com/Vacancies/'</nowiki>''... \n#* The following expressions are <span style=\"color:red\">'''not''' correct</span>: ''<nowiki>'https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''''[CustomerID]'''''<nowiki>.umantis.com/Vacancies/'</nowiki>''... and should be modified. <br>In this case, replace all occurrences of [CustomerID] with the number/ID of your Haufe solution. If the URL contains other variables that are not expressed in a valid form (in square brackets with no “pipe” characters), then please change these as well by adding the pipes (as shown in the ''correct'' example above: '|| '[''Variable'']' ||').\n: [[File:info.gif]] Check the SQL statement for all the job boards you use.\n\n\n'''Additional notes:'''<br>\n* You can set up '''as many job boards as you like''', i.e. the number of job boards is not fixed.\n* For job boards that specify a '''maximum publication period''', published jobs are automatically withdrawn when this period expires. For those job boards that have activated the email interface, a deactivation email is sent out when the posting is withdrawn.\n\n[[File:info.gif]]'''Note:'''<br>The publication period is set when the job is published. This means that changing the publication period has no effect on jobs that have already been published. To change the publication period for jobs that have already been published, the jobs must first be withdrawn and then republished. If '''no''' maximum publication period has been specified for a given job board, the job posting will automatically be withdrawn after 90 days.\n* For each job board, you can specify '''multiple branch offices''' that can use the given job board as a shared publication platform.\n* Only one '''publication language''' can be defined for each job board.\n* Job boards that should not be used for publishing jobs (e.g. only for test purposes) can be marked as '''“inactive”'''.\n* When setting up and configuring job boards (SQL), an additional “'''source'''” parameter can be added to the job posting URL in order to automatically record the source of the application (see '''[[Positions published externally|URL structure and parameters for a job posting]]''' (URL parameterization)).\n<br>\n'''Extracting and structuring job data with SQL and XSLT scripts'''<br>\nIn order to provide the relevant job data through the URL, an SQL script is needed to extract the data, along with an XSLT file to structure the data in a well-defined XML format.\n<br>\n<br>\n''Example: “SQL and XSLT files”:''<br>\nThe following two files are used as a basis for extracting and structuring job data for the job board at ''jobs.ch''. These scripts can be used as the basis for implementing other job boards as well.\n* XSLT file for structuring data (.xslt): [[File:Jobplatforms_Example_XSLT.xslt]]<br>\n* SQL file for extracting data (.txt): [[File:Jobplatforms_Example_SQL.txt]]<br>\n* Example XML output (.xml): [[File:Jobplatforms_Example_Output-XML.xml]]<br>\n‎\n\n==Deleting job boards==\nDeleting a job board means that the associated publication channel can no longer be used to publish new job postings. Jobs that are currently published on the job board can no longer be accessed after the job board is deleted, and the associated deactivation emails will not be automatically sent out.\n\n==Legacy job boards (HTML)==\nOlder job boards delivered job postings in a fixed, predefined structure (HTML), and used URLs based on the following template: “<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[IhreNummer].umantis.com/</nowiki><b>VacanciesPlattformA</b>”. As the use of job boards has expanded, these static job boards have been replaced with a more flexible approach, so that the publication structure can now be dynamically modified (through the use of SQL and XSLT), and the URLs are now accessed with numeric IDs. The static URLs are still supported for these “old” job boards to provide backward compatibility, and job postings published to these boards can be accessed with both the old URL structure and the new structure.<br><br>\nThe mapping from old to new structure is as follows:\n<br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>A</b> ==> 980<b>10</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>B</b> ==> 980<b>20</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>C</b> ==> 980<b>30</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>D</b> ==> 980<b>40</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>E</b> ==> 980<b>50</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>F</b> ==> 980<b>60</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>G</b> ==> 980<b>70</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>H</b> ==> 980<b>80</b><br>\n*VacanciesPlattform<b>J</b> ==> 980<b>90</b><br>\n\n\n==Also worth knowing==\n* [[Media:Ausschreiben_via_Jobplattformen.pdf| Publication through job platforms (PDF)]]\n\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[Publish vacancy|Publishing jobs]]\n*[[External vacancy notice|External job posting]]\n*[[Internal publication|Internal job posting]]\n*[[RSS Feeds|RSS feeds]]\n*[[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n*[[Positions published externally|URL structure and parameters for a posting]] (URL parameterization)\n*[[Positions published externally|Applicant source]]\n*[[IPM integration|IPM integration]]\n*[[CV Parsing|CV parsing]]\n*[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]\n*[[Xing|Xing]]\n*[[Aconso - Digital personnel file|Aconso — Digital personnel files]]\n*[[Job board provider|Job board providers]]\n*[[Video interview - Interview suite by viasto|Video interview — Interview suite by viasto]]"

Here, you can edit the details of the job’s description by clicking on the yellow pencil icon ([[File:Edit.gif]]). Under the “Internal information” header, you can attach internal documents and indicate the people responsible for this position. \n\n==General information==\n* The logo is used as a fallback resource for all job boards if no logo has been uploaded directly to the job board under [[Publish vacancy|Publication]] for a specific language.\n* The job number is an alphanumeric value. This means that letters can be used too. \n[[File:Info.gif‎]] However, it also means that jobs are sorted in alphanumeric order. Therefore, if you use digits only for your job numbers and want them to be correctly sorted, then you should use a fixed number of digits with leading zeros (e.g. 000001, 000002, 000023, 000123, ...) \n* The job title is displayed in internal jobs overviews and is not used as such on job boards. Therefore, this field can contain additional text that is not intended for applicants.\n\n==Information from the job requisition==\nClick on [[File:Edit.GIF]] to edit the job requisition information displayed here:\n* Type of request\n* Questions about the request\n* Requester\n* Replacement for\n* Preferred start date\n* Requires approval by\n* Reason for job requisition\n\n==Position description==\nClick on [[File:Edit.GIF]] to edit the information displayed here:\n* Expected start date\n* Starting as\n* etc.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The information displayed here is already defined when [[Create new job|creating a new job]], for example.\n\n==Applicant requirements==\nYou can fill in the “Education”, “Professional experience”, and “Special knowledge and skills” fields with your expectations for successful applicants. In the last field, you can select the degree or diploma that is required for the job you are trying to fill. \n\n==Responsibilities==\nClick on [[File:Edit.GIF|20px]] to edit the “Responsibilities” section. You can edit the following data in this section: \n* [[#Personalbetreuer|Responsible HR expert]]\n* [[#Personalbetreuer|Alternate HR expert]]\n* '''Automatically forward applications to hiring managers'''\n: If you activate this function, it is recommended that the responsible hiring managers (or alternate hiring managers) subscribe to the status \"Evaluation by manager\" so that they will receive a notification when new applications are submitted. <br>This setting is configured under [[Users overview (Applicant Management)#Settings (Applicant Management users)|User]], in the \"email notifications\" section (/Administration/Users/[ID]/Profile/ReminderSettings): \n: Here, next to “''Notify me by email when one of my applications changes to the following status:''”, select the [[Change process status|status]] “''Evaluation by manager''”.\n* '''Automatically forward applications to committees'''\n: For this field, select the committees to which the applications should be released automatically.\n: [[File:attention.gif]] Incoming applications will be immediately released to the specified committees. By default, all committee members assigned to a branch office will receive access permissions as soon as an application is released to the relevant committee. If this job requires access for a special combination of committee members, you can list the committee members (from one or more committees) who require access under “Special access for committees”.  \n* '''Forward an email to affected committee members for each application'''\n: This setting only takes effect when combined with “Automatically forward applications to committees”. \n===HR expert===\n* The '''responsible [[User roles in Applicant Management|HR expert]]''' sees the job and its applicants under “My jobs” and “My applications”, both in search filters and the search links on the home page. In addition, the HR expert’s contact data are included in the job posting, and can be inserted into [[Templates|communication templates]] such as letters and emails through variables like [Stellen.PBVorname], [Stellen.PBNachname],etc.\n* All '''alternate HR experts''' can access the jobs and their applications under “My jobs as alternate”.\n\n===Managers===\n* The '''responsible [[User roles in Applicant Management|manager]]''' is HR’s key partner in selecting an applicant, and has his or her own [[Access for line manager|hiring manager access]] to all jobs that fall under his/her responsibility and all [[Applications / Applicants overview#Forwarding applications|activated applications]] for those jobs. Depending on [[Configuration mode|which elements have been activated]], the responsible manager can view, edit and approve various content items for the job, and assess all applications that have been activated for his or her review. \n* '''Alternate managers''' have access to all jobs and applicants that have been activated for the responsible manager, and have the same access permissions to their profiles. \n\nExample: [Stellen.LVGVorname],[Stellen.LVGNachname]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Note that administrators or HR experts can also assign any manager that is visible to them to a job that they are allowed to edit.\n\n===Committee members===\n* Like managers, [[Activate for committees / retract committee access#Assign committee members|assigned]] '''committee members''' have access to all their assigned jobs and [[#Zuständigkeiten|activated applications]] through their own [[Access for committee member|committee member access]]. \n* Applications are '''activated for committees''' in one of two ways: \n:* automatically (''Automatically forward applications to committees'') — immediately upon the [[Create new job|creation of a new job]] or through the setting in the [[#Zuständigkeiten|Responsibilities]] section, or\n:* manually — through the multiple action “'''[[Activate for committees / retract committee access|Activate for committees]]''' in the [[Applications / Applicants overview|Applicant overview for the job]]. Applications can also be activated for selected committees here. \n: If the assessment link is [[Configuration mode|enabled for display]], the committee member can submit evaluations; otherwise, their access is read-only.\n\n==Branch office==\nA job is always assigned to a [[Branches|branch office]]. Administrators and HR experts with access to multiple branch offices can assign a job to a different branch office at any time. Assigning a job to a branch office controls all of its branch office-specific elements, including certain [[System-E-Mails|system emails]], template texts, and the privacy policy statement, which are managed in the [[Profile of branch office|branch office profile]], as well as publication options and visibility for HR experts and recruiters (published jobs only).  <br>[[File:info.gif]] '''Before''' you assign a job to a different branch office, make sure that the job has been retracted from all [[Vacancy notice (applicant management)|publication channels]] (see [[Internal publication (applicant management)|internal]] and [[External vacancy notice|external]] postings).\n\n==Special access for committees==\nThis view presents a table with an overview of the committee members assigned to the job. You can use the [[Activate for committees / retract committee access#Assign committee members|Assign committee members]] link to assign additional committee members.\nBy default, all committee members assigned to a branch office will receive access permissions when an application (for a job at this branch office) is released to the relevant committee. For this to work, you do not have to define the “Access for committees” for every job, but simply ensure that each committee member is assigned to the correct branch office. In specific cases where a job requires access for a special combination of committee members, you can list the committee members (from one or more committees) who require access under “Special access for committees”.\n\n==Other tabs==\n* Description\n* [[Approving jobs|Approval]]\n* [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]\n* [[Publish vacancy|External job posting]]\n* [[Internal publication (applicant management)|Internal job posting]]\n* [[Applications / Applicants overview|Applicant overview]]\n* [[Appointments|Appointments]]\n* [[Assessment|Assessment]]\n* [[Reminders|Reminders]]\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Register new application|Create new application]]\n* [[Copy vacancy|Copy job]]\n* [[Archive / reactivate job|Archive / reactivate job]]\n* [[Delete vacancy|Delete job]]\n* [[Create print view (ZIP archive)|Create print preview]]\n* [[Enter new reminder|Create reminder for this job]]\n\n[[File:Movie.gif]] [[Webinars#Applicant Management webinars|Webinars — Applicant Management]]"

Job alert subscriptions are available for [[Positions published externally|jobs published externally]] and [[Positions published on the intranet|jobs published on the intranet]], with further distinctions by publication language and branch office.\n\n==Subscribe to job alerts==\nPeople who are interested in coming to work at your company can set up a job alert subscription on your home page. This means that they enter their email address and a password of their choice, and select which types of job postings should be sent to them after they are posted to the home page. Registration involves a [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Opt-in#Double_Opt-in double opt-in] procedure. After registration, every time an [[User roles in Applicant Management#HR expert|HR expert]] or [[User roles in Applicant Management#Administrator|administrator]] externally publishes a job that meets the interested person’s criteria, an email is sent out.\n\n[[Integrating applicant management|Direct integration]]\n\n[[File:Info.gif]]\nIf a person has a user account in the SelfService view, then the name entered there is copied over and displayed in the HR view under “Job alert subscribers”. On the other hand, if the person does not have a user account in SelfService, then they can choose to set up a job alert subscription with their email address only. In this case, no name is displayed in the list of job alert subscribers in the HR view.\n\n==Modify job alert subscription criteria==\nA job alert subscription is especially useful when interested potential applicants can specify as exactly as possible which job postings they are interested in: full or part time, which field, which region, and much more. That way, potential applicants only receive those postings that correspond to their needs. The criteria selected for a job alert subscription can be modified in the SelfService view at any time.\n\n==Cancel a job alert subscription==\nIf a job alert subscriber no longer wants to be informed about job postings published by your company, they can cancel the job alert subscription in the SelfService view. They can also use the deactivation link that is included in every job alert subscription email. After cancellation, no more emails with job postings will be sent to that person.<br>\nJob alert subscribers who have either not logged in for two years, or do not have a job alert subscription less than two years old, will be deleted from Umantis.

This sort must always be based on the field XXX_rawdb. The counter is critical so that e.g. if 2 goals are present with the same weight / title, they will still be output. If this counter were not present, only one goal would be included in the print template in this case. The second goal would no longer appear. \nThe ascending sort order is then specified with the “reverse” command. (sort = alphabetical / nsort = numerical). The comparison “length != 1” checks whether a sort key longer than 1 character is present. This should always be checked, because otherwise an empty key could also be used. (empty line)"

For each published job, this job board determines the “optimal” language version for the visitor, which it then displays on the job board.\n\nThe job board is updated every 10 minutes, enabling faster response times. Changes to the job board may take up to 10 minutes to become visible.\n\n==Multilingual job boards==\nThe following job boards have multilingual functionality:\n* [[Positions published externally#External job board|External job board]] (/Jobs/All)\n* [[Positions published on the intranet#Internal job board|Internal job board]] (/VacanciesIntraxData/All)\n* [[Job market for recruiters|Job board for recruiters]] (/RecruiterJobs/All)\n\n==Determining the most appropriate language version for displayed content==\nThe optimal language version is determined through a pre-defined sequence of criteria; one key factor is whether the visitor is logged in or not.<br>\nPlease note that the following scenarios only apply to publication contents, and that the “surrounding language” (labels, informational texts etc.) are only covered up to step 2 in the sequence. At a minimum, the system/default language will be used for these texts. <br>[[File:Info.gif]] The same is true for the form view in [[Unsolicited application|unsolicited applications]]. \n<br>\nHowever, since publication contents must initially be published separately for each language in order to be displayed, there are two other possible steps in the sequence here.\n<br>\n<br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note as well that content that is presented in selection lists (employment period, position etc.) is also based on the “surrounding language” (only up to step 2 in the sequence), since the same selection value is used across all publication languages, and the goal is to ensure as much linguistic consistency as possible on the job board. Therefore, please make sure that each job posting for this job board is published in at least one of the typical job board languages (e.g. English or German as default language), in order to minimize the number of “language gaps” in the posting in that language.\n\n====Visitor is logged in====\n#User language\n#System language / Default language\n#''English''\n#Smallest language ID\n\nFirst, the user language is determined. If it cannot be found, then the system language is used instead. If the system language is not defined either, then the publication language is set to English, and the smallest language ID is used for everything else.\n\n====Visitor is not logged in====\n#Language used in the URL for the job board, e.g. /Jobs/All?lang=eng for English (US). This will cause all labels and texts to appear in this language.\n#System language / Default language\n#''English''\n#Smallest language ID\n\nFirst, the language from the initial page request is determined. If it cannot be found, then the system or default language is used instead. If the system/default language is not defined either, then the publication language is set to English, and the smallest language ID is used for everything else.\n\n====Example scenario====\n[[File:Mehrsprachiger Stellenmarkt.JPG|thumb|575px|Fig. 1: Language selection based on sequence of criteria]]\n{| class=\"wikitable justify\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 1\n|-\n|\nA user is browsing the job board.

For example, a new status can be assigned to several people simultaneously, or they can be sent a serial e-mail from template. \n\n==How does multi-select work?==\nAbove the table you have the following options to select records or to deselect them:\n\n*; Single selection:\n:By using single selection, you can '''select individual records''' to be targeted by the command to be executed.\n\n*; Selection by page:\n:With selection by page, you can '''select all records displayed on the page'''. To make this selection, click the “displayed” link at the top of the table. The displayed records are automatically selected with a check mark, and the link becomes inactive. To undo the entire selection, click the “none” link.\n\n*; Selecting all records: \n:To '''select all records simultaneously''', click on the “all” link. All existing records (not just the ones displayed) are selected by a check mark and can be edited. You can deselect individual records again by removing the check mark for each record. To undo the entire selection, click the “none” link.\n\n: [[File:info.gif]] If you select more than 1,000 values, a warning is displayed: ''''Warning! More than 1,000 items selected''''. This warning is intended to draw attention to potentially unintended selections, and to prevent unintended follow-up actions. \n: [[File:attention.gif]] Please note that multiple actions cannot be executed on more than 12,000 records. \n\n*; Unselect\n: '''Caution:''' If you click on the “none” link, '''all''' selected records (not just the ones displayed) will be “unselected” again. The selection of individual records can be undone by removing the corresponding check mark for each record.   \n\n[[File:info.gif]] When all records are selected, the command runs in the background so that you can continue working in Umantis. This process may take a few minutes, depending on the number of records to be processed. This means if you use this option to change the status of several people, you will continue to see the old status for another few seconds. To update the view, select the “Update page” function in your browser or press [F5]. Repeat the procedure if necessary.\n\n==How do multiple actions work?==\nTo perform a multiple action, select the records to be edited individually or in multi-select (see above). Then select the desired multiple action from the drop-down menu and click “Apply”. <br> [[File:attention.gif]] Please note that multiple actions cannot be executed on more than 12,000 records. \n\n===Number of entries selected===\nWhen applying certain multiple actions in Employee Management and Applicant Management (e.g. [[Archive / activate application(s)|Archive / activate application(s)]]), you will first receive a message about the multiple action you are about to perform. This message also includes a field for '''Number of entries selected:''' ''[number]'' <br> This field helps you to confirm that the correct number of entries have been selected. This reduces the risk of performing multiple actions on incorrectly selected records. If too many records were accidentally selected for a multiple action (e.g. through selection by page or by selecting “all”), then a correspondingly large number would be displayed in this field."

This offers you the following advantages:\n* Easier processing of emails for HR departments through direct imports to the Haufe solution.\n* Emails are assigned directly to applicants, provided they exist in Haufe (checked via email address).\n* You can specify three or more Haufe solutions into which emails can be imported.\n* The import is executed through the SOAP interface.\n \nA '''different plugin''' is required depending on which '''version of Outlook''' you use. Links to the relevant versions and installation instructions are below: \n* If you use '''Outlook 2010 or newer versions''', you can use the following plugin versions:\n:* [[Outlook plugin#Outlook plugin (from 2015 on)|Outlook plugin (from 2015 on)]]\n:* [[Outlook plugin#Outlook Plugin (2014)|Outlook Plugin (2014)]]\n* If you use a '''version of Outlook older than 2010''', choose\n:* [[Outlook plugin#Versions older than Outlook 2010|Outlook version older than 2010]]<br />\n\n[[File:info.gif]]The Mac version of Outlook is based on different technology, so the Outlook plugin cannot be run on a Mac.\n\n===Important notes===\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Please observe the following important notes on installing and using the Outlook plugin:'''\n{|style=\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa;\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"\n|style=\"background: lightyellow; color:#1C1924\"|\n* The Outlook plugin (all versions) provided by Haufe is only intended for use by HR departments.\n* It can be installed independently by the customer and operated with reference to the following documentation.\n* Haufe AG limits itself to verifying various target systems on the most accessible products and configurations used by our customers. Our test environments cover Outlook installations with and without a connection to Exchange. Other client specific environments e.g. Citrix are not tested by us and therefore not supported by our Support. The technical implementation for integration in Outlook is based on Microsoft standards and can therefore be generally implemented in any Windows-based environment.<br> Our set-up process installs and configures the plugin for all users present on the machine. Client-specific requirements with regard to loading behavior can be set-up after installation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386106.aspx), but are not supported by our Support team.\n|}\n \n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Important:''' The operational capability and compatibility of the plugin should be tested on all relevant and varied environments by the responsible IT department before and after an update. \n__TOC__\n\n=Outlook 2010 or newer versions=\n==Outlook plugin (from 2015 on)==\n \n* [[Outlook plugin#Function|Function]]\n: [[File:info.gif]] [[#Neues in Version 2017|New in 2017 version]] \n* [[Outlook plugin#System requirements|System requirements]]\n* [[Outlook plugin#Installation requirements|Installation requirements]]\n* [[Outlook plugin#Installation|Installation]]\n* [[Outlook plugin#Usage|Usage]]\n* [[Outlook plugin#Common error messages|Common error messages]]\n* [[Outlook plugin#FAQ — Frequently asked questions about the umantis Outlook plugin|FAQ]]\n \n===Function===\nThe new plugin works with Microsoft Outlook 2010, 2013, and 2016, and permits the upload of selected emails to one or more Haufe applications. An email can be imported with default settings in a single click (\"Fast Track\"). Alternatively, a dialog box is available to allow attachments, recipients, and the Haufe application to be edited before uploading. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important:''' The new Outlook plugin is designed to allow settings for permissions and Haufe applications to be managed all in one place. The configuration file can be stored at a central location on network storage or as a web resource; saving the configuration locally is still possible, but no longer recommended. If the configuration is publicly available (e.g. through a Web address), then the entries can be encrypted. This ensures that Haufe access data are always secret and secure.<br> \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''We recommend that only trained specialists (Haufe or IT administrators) be allowed to make changes to the configuration file.''' <br>Contact our [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com?subject=Outlook%20plugin&body=Contact%20us... Customer Service] team for more specific information about support packages for the new Outlook plugin.\n \nThe plugin comes in English and German languages. The language is automatically adjusted to match the language settings on your system.\n\n====New in 2017 version====\nWith the June 2017 version of the Outlook plugin, you can apply an [[#Admin-Modus|Admin mode]] and use a fully customizable [[#SOAP Request - Benutzerdefinierter User Agent|user agent]].\n\n[[File:info.gif]] To [[#Installation|installation files]].\n\n=====Admin mode=====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 60%;\"\n| Admin mode lets you apply a reset to restore the Haufe (import) status of emails that could not be uploaded (marked with [[File:Outlook_synch.png|20px]]) or mails that have already been uploaded. \n|[[File:Outlook_Admin.png|200px|thumbnail|Ansicht in Outlook: ''Reset umantis Outlook Mail Status''|left]]\n|-\n|}\n\nAdmin mode is automatically preselected at installation time.

If the default proxy settings do not reflect your (system) requirements, you can modify or specify the proxy setting directly in the plugin’s configuration file. \n\n'''File path:'''\n* '''32 bit:''' ''C:\\Program Files (x86)\\UmantisOutlookAddIn\\umantis.Outlook.AddIn.dll.config'' \n* '''64 bit:''' ''C:\\Program Files\\UmantisOutlookAddIn\\umantis.Outlook.AddIn.dll.config'' \n\n'''XML nodes'''\n* ''appSettings'' \n* ''System.net/defaultProxy'' \n\n'''Example scenario:'''\n <appSettings> \n    <add key=\"proxyaddress\" value=\"http://localhost:8888\"/> \n    <add key=\"username\" value=\"1\"/> \n    <add key=\"password\" value=\"1\"/> \n    <!-- <add key=\"userAgent\" value=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; rv:11.0) like Gecko\"/>     --> \n </appSettings> \n <system.net> \n    <defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials=\"false\" > \n      <module type=\"umantis.Outlook.AddIn.Network.CustomCredentialsProxy, umantis.Outlook.AddIn\"/> \n    </defaultProxy> \n  </system.net>\n\n====Save location / Path to configuration file====\nWe recommend that you specify the storage location for the configuration file right away when deploying the plugin with the installer (UI or unattended). The configuration can also be done manually later on through the Outlook add-in options. \n\nIn Outlook, go to ''File > Options > Add-Ins > Add-In Options'' to enter the path to the configuration file (.json). For the save location, you have the following options:\n* Path to a locally saved configuration file\n* Path to a configuration file saved on a network (UNC path)\n* Path to a configuration file saved on a web server (\"http\" or \"https\" URL with \".json\" extension)\n* DNS Discovery / DNS search: SRV record\n: No storage location is configured when using DNS Discovery. Through a dedicated SRV record on your DNS server, the Web storage location is automatically read and configured when Outlook starts up.  \n \nIndependent of the selected save location, the DNS/address information must always be modified accordingly.\n\n====DNS Discovery====\nThe umantis Outlook plugin can retrieve a setting’s web-based save location through DNS Service Discovery. This is done by copying an SRV entry to the client domain.\nThe SRV entry must be named _umantis._tcp.<domain>. and contain a (Web) address (URL) for the settings file (e.g.: <nowiki>https://umantis.ch/public/umantisoutlookdevsettings.json</nowiki>). It is important that the DNS entry is named accordingly as required by the plugin. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]]This variation is preferred because it does not need any client configuration.\n \nThe configuration in Windows DNS manager can be e.g. carried out as follows:\n[[File:DNS_Discovery.png|thumb|none|left|400px|Figure: Windows DNS Manager]]\n \n=====Check the SRV record=====\nTo ensure the SRV record is available, follow the following steps (providing the Outlook plugin is not installed yet):\n# Open command shell (Windows: ''Start > Run > '''cmd''''' type ''> OK'')\n# '''Type “nslookup”''' and confirm with ENTER\n# '''Type “set type=all”''' and confirm with ENTER\n# '''Type :_umantis._tcp.{yourDomainName}”''' and confirm with ENTER\n# All SRV information, including the public URL, will then be listed.\n \n====Encrypting with Encryption Helper====\n \n[[File:info.gif]] Encryption Helper can help you encrypt data that you have stored in the configuration file. If the configuration file is stored in a public location (public URL), you should definitely use encryption due to the danger of external parties entering the public URL in their plugin. This would allow emails to be uploaded to third-party systems. It is generally recommended to store an encrypted central configuration file (in an internal network — UNC address / Intranet).\n \nEncryption can be completed with the Encryption Helper. You can find the following corresponding installation file:\n* [[Media:Umantis.Outlook.AddIn.SettingEncryptionHelper.Setup.zip|EncryptionHelper.Setup.zip]] <br>\n=====Encryption Helper instructions=====\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:1200px\"> '''> Open the Encryption Helper instructions'''    (Click on \"Expand\") <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n \nStart the UMANTIS SETTING ENCRYPTION HELPER and follow the steps listed under the diagram.\n:[[File:Encryption_Helper_Description.png|border|1200px|right]]\n \n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"> '''1:''' </span> Enter any initial key in the '''Key Generation Initializer''' field. \n \n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"> '''2:''' </span> Click on '''generate'''.\n \n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"> '''3:''' </span> The generated key is displayed in the '''Key''' field.

Restart Outlook.\n</div></div>\n \n====Authorizing and validating user group names====\nEveryone has authorized access to the plugin by default. If a person is given specific access, all other persons still have access to the plugin because default authorizations have a higher priority. In such a scenario, everyone’s access has to be removed to subsequently add selective access.\n \nYou can find the UserGroupNameValidator installation file below if you deal with the validation of specific user group names.\n:* [[Media:umantis.Outlook.AddIn.UserGroupNameValidator.zip|UserGroupNameValidator.zip]]\n:: Use the UserGroupNameValidator as help if you want to restrict use of the plugin to a specific user group (e.g. only the HR department). The restriction should then also be stored in the configuration file.\n\n===Usage===\n\n[[File:info.gif]] There is no explicit encryption of emails.\n\nThe plugin sends emails from Outlook to the Haufe solution and assigns them automatically when possible.\nTo do this follow these steps:\n# Select the emails in Outlook that you want to import to Haufe. If you want to upload multiple emails simultaneously (up to 10), select the emails.\n# Once the emails have been selected, click on either the icon [[File:Icon_Outlook_plugin_2015.png|50px|border]] or on > ''umantis Outlook Mail Exchange''. \n# This opens the following dialog window:<br> [[File:1_Screen_Import.png|600px|border]]\n# Select the emails and attachments that you want to import.\n# On the right, select the application into which you want to import the email(s).\n# Once you have provided all the necessary information, click Start to begin importing the selected emails and attachments. <br> [[File:info.gif]] During the import, you will see a status bar that shows the progress; after the import is complete, it may display a status with further notes on the process.\n# Import completed: <br>[[File:2_Screen_Import.png|600px|border]] <br>[[File:info.gif]] In the above example, a notification under \"Status\" indicates that the emails could not be assigned. This occurs when the email address is not recorded in the Haufe solution. In this scenario, you have the option (with \"Open in umantis\") to manually assign the emails in your Haufe solution.\n\n====Assigning imported emails==== \n* If the email address is recorded in Haufe and assigned to a job application, the emails will be stored in the Communication tab (Application documents > ''Communication''tab). \n* The attachments are stored in the application documents under \"Documents\" (also as a [[Generate PDF summary|PDF compilation]]).\n----\n; Reference code\n('''Prerequisite:''' You must have configured the settings in the following section: [[Settings_for_company_/_organization_profile#Miscellaneous|Organizational profile]])<br>\nThe reference code added to outgoing emails allows emails to be attributed to a specific application. Please note that this reference code should not be (manually) deleted from the subject line. \n----\n'''Assignment failed:'''\n* If the imported emails cannot be assigned, they will be stored under “Communication > Unassigned emails”. \n* If the imported emails can be assigned to a person but not to an application, they will be stored under “Communication > Communication history” and can be viewed for that person in any application under “Other communication with applicant”.\n\n: '''Emails cannot be assigned if:''' \n:* Email address is not recorded in Haufe\n::-> Effect: The email is stored in the “Communication > Unassigned emails” area\n:* Email address is not uniquely assigned (= multiple people have the same email address) \n::-> Effect: The email is stored in the “Communication > Unassigned emails” area.\n:* A person has more than one active application in the system (in this case, the system has no way of knowing which application it should copy the documents to) \n::-> Effect: The email is not assigned to the applicant (person), but rather to the application. The attachments are not copied to an application. This email can be viewed in any of the applicant’s applications in the “Other communication with applicant” table, and in the general communication history.\n\n====Common error messages====\n* [[File:Outlook_synch.png|20px]] '''''Archiving in progress''''' (emails are not uploaded)\n: This icon appears in Outlook next to emails that you are currently uploading. If this icon does not disappear on its own (to be replaced by the umantis icon), enter Admin mode (available [[#Installation|starting with the June 2017 plugin version]]). \n\n* '''Dialog box could not be opened'''\n:[[File:Fehlermeldung_Outlook_plugin_2015.png|thumb|none|left|400px|Figure: Error message]]\n:This error message occurs when e.g. a key is needed to use the plugin. The key can be added in Add-In-Options. Contact your system administrator or IT department if you get these error messages.\n\n* '''''\"<nowiki>could not upload file '$name' to application, because there is no application or more than one active application for person '$persid_assigned_person'</nowiki>\"'''''\n: This log message appears when an applicant has more than one application in the system. In this case, a unique assignment is impossible, and the emails are simply assigned to the person.\n\n===FAQ — Frequently asked questions about the umantis Outlook plugin===\n \n* '''Does the plugin work with Office 365?'''\n: '''Answer:''' More information is provided in the section on [[Outlook plugin#Microsoft Office 365|Microsoft Office 365]].\n \n* '''Are the data that are transferred through the plugin encrypted?'''\n: '''Answer:''' Yes, the data are encrypted before being transferred. The key factor here is the umantis [[SOAP import|SOAP interface]], which is SSL-encrypted. The Outlook plugin is a client of this interface and connects to it using the URL in the settings. This URL always uses \"https\".\n \n* '''Will the plugin also work in a Citrix environment?'''\n: '''Answer:''' The Outlook plugin works also in Citrix environments. In addition, the plugin is optimized for Citrix environments using \"Native Image Generator\" (ngen). Please note that we do not provide support for Citrix-related problems (see [[#Important notes|notes in upper section]]). \n\n* '''Can the plugin also be used without a configuration file?'''\n: '''Answer:''' No. The import settings for URL, ID and password are customer-specific.

These links have a kind of “intelligence”, i.e. they can access environment variables and start specific processes in the background. The original functionality of a link (displaying a new page) can be significantly extended with the use of parse links. \n\n==Parse link example==\nA few parse links can be found under Application documents, in the “Applications” subsection. For example, the '''Directions for applicants''' is a parse link (<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[ID].umantis.com/Recruiting/Applications/</nowiki>[ID]/[ID]/Details?'''ParseLinkID=18''') that accesses saved [[Application documents#Contact information|applicant contact information]] and [[Branches#Branch office profile|company address information]]. When the user clicks on “''Directions for applicants''” link, these data are automatically entered in the Start and Destination fields of a request for directions from Google Maps, and the appropriate route is then displayed. You can configure this parse link as follows: \n* Click on “Applicant Management” > “Applications” and select a specific application.\n* Under [[Application documents|Application documents]], you will find the “Applications” section at the left with multiple parse links. \n* Click on [[Configuration mode|Configure view]] and then on [[File:Config.gif]] next to the “Directions for applicants” link. \n* On the next screen, you will then see the following information: \n:* '''Original content — Link template:''' ''<nowiki>http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=[Empfaenger.PLZ] [Empfaenger.Ort] [Empfaenger.Adresse]&daddr=[Firma. PLZ] [Firma.Ort] [Firma.Adresse]&hl=de</nowiki>'' <br> [[File:info.gif]] In this case, the link template already includes all the information (+ [[Variables|variables]]) needed to request directions: \n::* Applicant contact information: ''[Empfaenger.PLZ], [Empfaenger.Ort], [Empfaenger.Adresse]''\n::* Company address: ''[Firma. PLZ], [Firma.Ort], [Firma.Adresse]''\n\n:* '''Original content — Link text:''' ''<nowiki><div class='icon igooglemaps'></div> Directions for applicants</nowiki>'' <br>[[File:info.gif]] In this case, the original values show a Google Maps icon and the link text “Directions for applicants”. \n\n'''Other examples of parse links:'''\n* “Release on network” — This link releases specific personal information on the network, allowing your colleagues to view it. \n* “Show address on Google Maps”\n* “View XING profile”\n* “Search for LinkedIn profile”\n* [[Settings in employee file#Linked users & access profiles|Profile links in the employee file settings]] (links to the person) which are also displayed as links to the [[Employee file#Business card|business card]] once they are released.\n* + other '''[[User-defined links|user-definable links]]''' that can be configured as parse links.\n[[IPM integration|IPM integration]] provides another example of how parse links can be used."

The jobs advertised here are controlled from the [[Publish vacancy|expert view]] for HR experts/recruiters.\n\n[[Applicant management#Navigating_in_the_.27HR_expert_area.27|Overview of expert view in Applicant Management]]\n\n==Controlling and setting properties of the job board==\nYou can use URL path identifiers and URL parameters (CGI parameters) to control and configure the properties of a job board and its postings, as well as how they are displayed.\n* The job board can be subdivided into sub-boards by '''branch office''' and by '''language''' (the language is controlled through an ID).\n* Each jobs overview can have its own '''design''', its own [[Welcome and job subscription email|welcome emails]]''', and its own '''job alert subscription'''.\n* You can also activate '''unsolicited application links''' separately for each branch office. Applicants who are currently unable to find an appropriate job to apply to, but who would still like to express their interest in joining your company, can either [[Create new speculative application|submit an unsolicited application]] or set up a job alert subscription so they can be sure not to miss a single opportunity.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:'''\n\n* To ensure that job postings on the external job board (/Jobs/All) have a consistent appearance, you should never activate more than one job posting image in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]]. If you are seeing duplicated images in the jobs overview on the external job board, it is recommended that you hide the second image via [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]]. \n\n===URL structure and parameters for the job board===\nThe job board is introduced by the URL path identifier “'''Jobs'''”, followed by multiple URL control elements and parameters.\n<br><br>\n“<nowiki>https: //recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''[CustomerID]'''.umantis.com/Jobs/'''[LanguageID]'''?'''CompanyID'''=[ID]&'''DesignID'''=[ID]&'''lang'''=[ID]\"\n<br><br>\n* '''[CustomerID]''': Corresponds to the customer ID (e.g. “133”).\n* '''[LanguageID]''': Corresponds to the language ID for the publication contents (e.g.: 1 = German (Switzerland), 31 = German (Germany), 2= English, 3 = French, 4 = Italian, etc.; the list of all IDs can be found under [[Languages|Languages]]).<br>In addition to language-specific job board calls, you can also call up the job board independently of language. To do this, use the '''All''' parameter (e.g. /Jobs/'''All''').\n<br>\n'''Parameter:'''<br>\n* '''CompanyID=[ID]''': Corresponds to the ID of a specific branch office. For example, this parameter can be used to display only those jobs that are associated with the specified branch office. If this parameter is left out, then all externally-published jobs from all branch offices will be displayed. If you use job boards for individual branch offices, then you should use the parameter '''CompanyID=All''' for the global job board (resets all saved CompanyID parameters). If you would like to combine multiple branch offices in a single overview, then separate the IDs for those branch offices with the pipe character ‘|’ (e.g. '''CompanyID=19|15|1''').\n* '''DesignID=[ID]''': Corresponds to the page’s design ID. The [[Other designs|individual designs]] must be created beforehand. The correct ID can be found on the page where it was created. This parameter is optional and can also be left out; in that case, the general [[External appearance|external design]] is then displayed. '''DesignID=00''' resets all saved DesignID parameters (to the default design).\n* '''lang=[ID]''': Corresponds to the language of the environment. In Haufe, the “label language” can be different from the “content language”. Each page can be displayed at any time in the relevant language (e.g. ?lang=ger or ?lang=eng) without affecting which content is drawn from the database. The list of all language parameters can be found under [[Languages|Languages]].\n\n<br>\n''Example URL:''<br>\n<nowiki>https: //recruitingapp-123.umantis.com/Jobs/1?CompanyID=19&DesignID=1001&lang=eng</nowiki>\n<br><br>\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n* The list of parameters begins with “'''?'''”, and individual parameters are separated with “'''&'''”. The parameters can be added in any order.\n* The square brackets “'''['''” and “''']'''” should be left out.\n* The “DesignID”, “CompanyID” and “lang” parameters have an ongoing effect, and only have to be specified once. The “lang” parameter is overwritten after login by the current user language.\n* Jobs can be published to the [[Positions published on the intranet|internal job board (intranet)]] in much the same way (but introduced by the URL path identifier “'''VacanciesIntraxData'''”).\n<br>\n\n===URL structure and parameters for a posting===\nA posting is introduced by the URL path identifier “'''Vacancies'''”, followed by multiple URL control elements and parameters.\n<br><br>\n<nowiki>\"https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''[CustomerID]'''.umantis.com/Vacancies/'''[PositionID]'''/Description/'''[LanguageID]'''?lang='''[ID]'''\"\n\n* '''[CustomerID]''': Corresponds to the customer ID (e.g. “133”).\n* '''[PositionID]''': Corresponds to the job ID (e.g. “119”).\n* '''[LanguageID]''': Corresponds to the language ID for the publication contents and the [[Welcome and job subscription email|welcome email]] that is sent out (e.g. 1 = German (Switzerland), 31 = German (Germany), 2= English, 3 = French, 4 = Italian, etc.; the list of all IDs can be found under [[Languages|Languages]]).\n* lang='''[ID]''': Up until the moment when the user logs in, this parameter determines in which temporary user language the interface (labels, navigation) should be displayed. After the user logs in, this is controlled by the selected user language. Accordingly, you can distinguish the “label language” from the “content language” in Haufe, and every page can be shown translated into the appropriate language at any time (e.g. ?lang=ger or ?lang=eng) without affecting which content is drawn from the database. The list of all language parameters can be found under [[Languages|Languages]]. \n\n====Source markings / parameters====\nSource markings allow you to identify applications that were received from other job boards or through a referral program. The ID assigned to each application allows its source to be uniquely identified. If you perform an [[Search functions#Advanced Search|Advanced Search]], you can search by “Has source marking”. This search will return a list of all applications that have a source marking. You can also use Advanced Search to search for a specific source marking (e.g. “Has source ID”) or a specific unique ID.\n\n* '''?tracking_id='''[ID]\n: When using a [[Referral program|referral program]], the tracking ID is used to track applications to a given job. This ID can be an alphanumeric value.\n: Example URL: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Vacancies/[ID]/Description/1</nowiki>'''?tracking_id=al76u7vtjqJ'''''\n\n* '''?srcID='''[ID]\n: The source ID is a numeric value that provides information about the source of the application. \n: Example URL: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Vacancies/[ID]/Application/CheckLogin/[langID]</nowiki>'''?srcID=123'''\n\n* '''?srcText='''[Text]\n: The source text is a value that provides information about the source of the application. \n: Example URL: ''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Vacancies/[ID]/Application/CheckLogin/[langID]</nowiki>'''?srcText=abc'''\n\n*'''source='''[ID]\n: The URL parameter “source” is used to transfer and track information about where applications come from. The URL parameter (CGI parameter) is used during the application process to pre-select the “''How did you find out about us?''” field in the application form. The applicant still has the option to set the value of this field manually. However, automatic preselection for this field leads to a significant improvement in the quality of data collection, since it covers the cases where the applicant does not explicitly fill in the field themselves.\n:: '''Example:''' <nowiki>\"https://recruitingapp-133.umantis.com/Vacancies/119/Description/1?</nowiki>'''source=indeed'''\"\n:: '''Note:''' In order for the correct list entry to be pre-selected on the application form when the URL parameter is transferred, the URL parameters must be saved as '''codes''' for the [[Selection lists|selection list]] “''How did you find out about us?''”.\n:: When setting up and configuring '''[[Job boards|job boards]]''', the job posting URL you submit can be extended with this parameter as appropriate for each job board (e.g. “''indeed''” or “''jobs_ch''”). When an applicant uses the URL to view the job posting, the parameter is activated and the applicant source is recorded.<br>The “''How did you find out about us?''” selection list must also be visible on the application form in order for this parameter to have an effect. \n\n\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n* The list of parameters begins with “'''?'''”, and individual parameters are separated with “'''&'''”.

Therefore, add appropriate “meta” tags in the Head section of the [[Create advertisement layout|job posting]]. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please also take note of the relevant notes and information on [[Web tracking|web tracking]] and the [[Web tracking#Robots Exclusion Standard in Haufe|Robots Exclusion Standard in Haufe]].\n\n== Related topics ==\n* [[Integrating applicant management|Overview of all Haufe home pages and example parameter settings]]\n* [[Profile of branch office|Activate and configure welcome email, job alert subscription, and unsolicited applications in the branch office profile]]\n* '''Job posting'''\n** [[Internal publication|Internal job posting]]\n** [[External vacancy notice|External job posting]]\n** [[Job boards|Job boards]]\n** [[RSS Feeds|RSS feeds]]\n** [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n* '''Job boards'''\n** [[Positions published externally#External job board|External job board]]\n** [[Positions published on the intranet#Internal job board|Internal job board (intranet)]]\n** [[Job market for recruiters|Job board for recruiters]]\n** [[Multilingual job market|Multilingual job board]]"

As is customary in the case of a bulk letter, place [[Variables|variables]] at the points at which recipient-related or sender-related, personal information from the database is to be inserted. For how to get the right variables, see [[Variables#Activate Variable Finder|Enable variable finder]].\n\n==Upload document==\n\nWhen you have completed the document and inserted the variables you want, click the \"Save under...\" command and select RTF (Rich Text Format) as the file type. Upload the template you have created to Haufe, and give it a name. Click \"Save\" to return to the \"Templates\" tab in the overview, where the template you have just uploaded should appear at the top of the table.\n\n==Tips from consultants==\n*  The easiest way to create a new certificate template is to copy an existing template and change the text.\n*  You can format a template in any way you want. However, you should ensure that no formatting begins or ends in the middle of a variable - i.e. between the square brackets. Otherwise, in the background MS Word will save the formatting information in the middle of the variable, and Haufe will no longer recognize the variable.\n*  If your template starts with a variable (e.g. [Sender.Name]), Word automatically takes the first characters in the document as the description of the file properties. Because the bracket has not been closed correctly, this results in an empty document. Overwrite the description in the file properties with a text without a variable, and re-save the document.\n*  If there are images in the template and it is saved as an RTF, they will be very large and they will also be very large in any letters and print views that are created. This will slow down the generation of letters and print views. [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] This can be avoided by selecting the \"Compress images\" option right next to the save button in the \"Save as\" dialogue box in \"Tools\", and select the degree of compression you want.\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  [[Certificates|Certificates]]\n*  [[Events|Events]]\n*  [[Templates|Templates]]"

						"__text": "[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[de:Personalvermittler]]\nHaufe [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]] gives you the ability to include one or more [[User roles in Applicant Management#HR expert|recruiters]] in the process. First, the recruiters are created in the system. After receiving the login data in a system email, you can [[Register new application|enter applications]] as appropriate. Recruiters see the following jobs:<br>\n* Jobs that have been directly assigned to them.\n* Jobs for which they have no relevant [[Recruiter#Job posting restriction|publication restrictions]].\n* Jobs that have been flagged as [[Recruiter#Job posting restriction|Release to all recruiters with job posting restrictions]].<br>\n\nHR experts process incoming applications, do a preselection pass, and forward the application to other people who then assess the applications. Clicking on a recruiter will take you to their [[Recruiter profile|recruiter profile]].\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that recruiters do not have access to [[Archive / reactivate job|archived jobs]], and therefore cannot create applications for those jobs — even if they have been [[#Zuweisung / Beauftragung von Personalvermittlern für ausgeschriebene Stellen|assigned]] to those jobs. \n\n==Assessing applications==\nIf a recruiter has created an application for a job, this will be indicated on your home page. You may proceed in the same way as when receiving an application that was created by the applicant themselves. Do your [[Applications / Applicants overview#Preselection of applicants|preselection]] pass and [[Applications / Applicants overview#Forwarding applications|forward the application to other people]] so that they can [[Applications / Applicants overview#Assessing the application|assess]] it.\n\n==Job posting restriction==\nJob posting restrictions serve to reduce a recruiter's access to currently published jobs which also need to be specially released in addition to being published. Without this access restriction, a recruiter would be able to see all currently published jobs in their view ('''/SelfServiceRecruiter'''). Releasing a job posting to recruiters can happen in one of two ways:\n\n* '''Activate job posting restriction:''' Under the “Recruiter” tab for the person themselves, a so-called “job posting restriction” can be specified in the person's basic info. If you check this box, the recruiter can then only see published jobs that have also been released for recruiters with job posting restrictions in the “Publication settings”.\n\n* '''Release a job posting for recruiters with a job posting restriction:''' A job posting can be released globally for all recruiters with job posting restrictions from directly within the job record itself — under '''Publication -> Publication settings''', then in the language-independent settings under '''Release for all recruiters with job posting restrictions'''. If you check this box AND the job has been published, then even recruiters with an “activated” publication restriction can see this job in their publication overview. <br>\n\n==Assigning / Contracting recruiters for published jobs==\nAs an alternative to the procedures described above, you can also assign recruiters directly with the “'''Add new recruiter'''” action. You can do this in the “Assigned recruiters” section (''/Recruiting/Vacancies/[ID]/Publication'', or under ''Applicant Management > Jobs > (select job) > Publication > “Assigned recruiters” section'').\n\nThe difference between these two variants is that by setting the flag '''“Release to all recruiters with job posting restrictions”''', you release the posting to all recruiters simultaneously, whereas if you assign a recruiter in the '''“Assigned recruiters”''' section, you are contracting '''only certain recruiters''' for external recruiting. (Recruiters with no job posting restriction will continue to see ALL job postings — regardless of the release settings in the recruiter view, “'''/SelfServiceRecruiter'''”.)\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important notes:''' \n* Please continue to observe the restrictions on the recruiter's branch office membership. If you grant a global release with “Release to all recruiters with job posting restrictions”, then the recruiter’s branch office membership applies. If you assign a recruiter directly to a job posting, then the branch office membership is overridden, and this also applies with regard to access to the given job posting.\n\n* When a recruiter is assigned directly to the job (i.e. contracted), they will immediately see the job in their cockpit even if it is not posted, and can also upload applications.\n\n==Brief message to the recruiter==\nYou can write a brief message to the recruiter directly in the applicant’s file. The message is then displayed in the [[Access for recruiter|recruiter view]] in the applicant overview.\n\n==Communication with the recruiter==\nThe following variables are available for the recruiter:\n\n{|\n|-\n! Use\n! Variable\n|-\n| Formal salutation\n| PVBewerber.AnredeFormell\n|-\n| Informal salutation\n| PVBewerber.AnredeInformell\n|-\n| Applicant’s first name\n| PVBewerber.Vorname\n|-\n| Applicant’s last name\n| PVBewerber.Name\n|-\n| Applicant salutation\n| PVBewerber.Anrede\n|-\n| Applicant’s street address\n| PVBewerber.Adresse\n|-\n| Applicant's ZIP/postal code\n| PVBewerber.PLZ\n|-\n| Applicant city\n| PVBewerber.Ort\n|-\n| Applicant country\n| PVBewerber.Land\n|-\n| Applicant's birthdate\n| PVBewerber.GebDat\n|-\n| Applicant’s telephone number\n| PVBewerber.Telefon\n|-\n| Applicant’s email address\n| PVBewerber.Email\n|-\n|}\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Create new recruiter|Create new recruiter]]\n==Multiple actions==\n* Send login data for cockpit\n* [[Send email from template|Send email(s) from template]]\n* Send email(s) through new template\n* Create letter from template\n* [[Change Status|Change status]] and send email(s) to recruiter \n* [[Change Status|Change status]] and send letter(s) to recruiter \n* Send email(s) to recruiter\n* Send letter(s) to recruiter"

Thus, the whole role and authorization assignment can be maintained in the SAP source system by enriching the customer's infotype (9736) with the appropriate information.

Note that with full-text search, no more than 200 characters can be entered in a search field; otherwise, an error message will appear. \n\nSelect the desired search filters, then click on “Search”. The result will be displayed in a table on the right.\n\nThe selected search filters can be changed at any time. Clicking again on “Search” will execute the search with the modified settings. To further restrict the result, you can add other search filters. You can also [[Use placeholders|use wildcards]] when filtering on specific individual fields.\n\nThe filters you set will remain active even if you have left the page and come back. Click on the '''“Reset search”''' link, next to the list of selected search filters, to reset your search filters and go back to seeing all entries.\n\nSearch functions for tables within an entity (e.g. all applications for a job, all participants in an event) can be found above the table, and can be '''minimized''' to save space. These search blocks can be expanded with [[File:Folding open.gif]] and closed with [[File:Folding close.gif]]. \n<br /><br />\n[[File:Info.gif]] Note that searches with special characters do not work, and therefore will not return any search results.\n<br />\n\n==Configuration of the immediately displayed options in the search offer==\nWith the option '''Immediate display as search offer''' you have the possibility to determine if the field should be displayed immediately or in the further filters.\n\n'''Immediate display as search offer:''' \n* default\n* show directly active (true)\n* show only active when chosen (false)\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Attention:''' To update the displayed filter (after configuration), logout and deletion of browser cookies is required.\n\n==My default search==\n\nBy using the '''“My default search”''' link, each user can choose for themselves which of the available search filters should be active when the given overview is first opened. In this way, the default search provided by Haufe can be individually customized. <br>\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Only fields that are displayed in the search itself are visible under “My default search”.<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] For jobs, the search filter ''Active jobs only'' or ''Active applications only'' is preselected by default. When this filter option is [[Configuration mode|displayed]], users will only see '''active''' jobs and applications.\n\n==Remember search==\nYou can also save your search in order to reuse it later. To do this, click on '''“Remember search”''' to create a bookmark.\n\n==Search over selection lists==\nWhen searching over a selection list, one or more selection list values (depending on the filter) can be selected for the search.\n<br /><br />\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] When searching over multi-level hierarchical selection lists, all higher- and lower-level categories are included. \n\nFor example: Region\n\nGermany\n> Southern Germany\n>> Bavaria\n>>> Munich\n>>> Nuremberg\n>> Baden-Württemberg \n\n* A job is published for the Munich region. This job will be displayed when searching for jobs in the regions of Southern Germany, Bavaria or Munich. \n* A job is published for the Southern Germany region (either because the exact location is not yet certain, or because this job involves working at multiple locations in southern Germany). This job will be displayed when searching for jobs in Munich, Nuremberg, Bavaria or Baden-Württemberg (since the job could potentially be performed in the searched sub-region).\n\nFields from selection lists of the same type (e.g. HR expert, HR expert advanced) can only be queried with advanced search. \n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''On the jobs overview, for example, the search will not yield any results if selection lists of the same type are displayed multiple times.'''\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' In principle, it is possible with all selection lists or dropdown fields to search directly for an entry. However, this functionality is restricted to multi-selection lists with '''fewer than 2001''' elements, as otherwise there is a risk that the [[System requirements#Browser and operating system|browser]] will hang.\n\n==Search based on period settings==\nSearches that relate to periodically saved values always include the [[Planning periods|period]] in their name/label, e.g. for the employee review meeting: Search for employee review meeting status 2014\n\nFor career planning or assessment of employee potential, the current values for the employee are used for the search. Take note of the guidelines on [[Potential|periodic and aperiodic assessments]].\n\n==Text search==\n* The “Starts with...” search can be used to search over everything by using the '''*''' wildcard.\n* For the “Starts with name” search, the '''last''' name is always used. <br>[[File:info.gif]] Use the * wildcard to search for the '''first''' name.\n\n==Advanced Search==\nUse the advanced search to specify detailed search filters, thereby narrowing your search results.\n\nWhere to find the advanced search:\n* in '''Applicant Management''': e.g. in the overview of all applications ( /Recruiting/Applications (''/Recruiting/Applications'') \n* in '''Employee Management''': e.g. in the people directory (''/ExternalParticipants''), in the event overview (''/Courses'') or under Registrations (''/Courses/Participation'').\n\n\n===Advanced search for data release settings/decisions===\n[[File:GDPR.png|50px]]\n\nYou can use the advanced search to search on criteria related to the data release. \n\n====Applicant Management====\nIn Applicant Management, you can use the advanced search in the overview of all applications (''/Recruiting/Applications'') and use the following data release criteria: \n* ''Pending decision on data release''\n* ''Data release''\n: O ''Yes, I accept that my data will be saved even after this specific job is filled, and that I will be notified of other interesting job offers.''\n: O ''No, I prefer that my data be deleted when the current application process is over.''\n* ''Data release consent required''\n: This will search for applications for which the branch office requires a decision for the data release.\n* ''Data release consent modified in the past 7 days''\n: This will search for applications for which the data release has been modified within the last 7 days.\n----\n* ''Data release not yet requested''\n: Searches for applications for which the data release has not yet been requested.\n* ''Data release requested on: (From/to date)''\n: Searches for applications for which the data release was requested in the specified time period. \n----\n\n====Employee management====\nIn Employee Management, you can use the advanced search in the [[People directory|people directory]] (''/ExternalParticipants'') or in the (event) [[Registrations|registrations]] area (''/Courses/Participation'') and use the following data release criteria in your search:\n\n* ''Data release consent required''\n: This will search for external individuals with no historized position (Only non-former employees) and with no instructor marking. \n* ''Pending decision on data release''\n: This will search for external individuals with no historized position (Only non-former employees) and with no instructor marking, and who have not yet submitted their data release consent form.\n* ''Data release consent given or not required''\t\n* ''Data release''\n: O ''Yes, I agree that my data may be saved even after the end of my specific participation, and that I may be informed of other interesting offers.''\n: O ''No, I want my data to be deleted after my current participations are completed.''\nIn the people directory, you can also perform advanced searches on: \n* ''Data release consent modified in the past 7 days''\n: This will search for people whose the data release has been modified within the last 7 days.\n* ''People with no current event participations''\n: In connection with the search for ‘Data release = No’, these people should be regularly removed from the database.\n\n----\n\n==Special search functions==\n* [[Full-text search|Full-text search]]\n* [[Interactive search|Interactive search]]\n* [[Use placeholders|Use wildcards]]"

When doing this, it is recommended that you restrict the integration options under ''Settings > Security settings'' . Restricting integration prevents misuse through so-called [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking clickjacking]. \n\nIn the “Restrictions on integration” area, you can implement the following settings (known as “whitelisting”) in two sections: \n\n* In the upper section, you can explicitly specify the URLs into which the '''internal view of umantis''' (e.g. HR, Administration) can be integrated. <br>If you are integrating Umantis into your website via iframe, you would enter the website’s URL here (e.g. <nowiki>http://www.company.com</nowiki>). Note that only one URL should be entered here.\n* In the lower section, you can enter multiple URLs (separated by commas) into which the '''external view of umantis''' (e.g.: /SelfService, /SelfServiceLine) can be integrated. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Important notes:''' <br>\n\n:* If you '''do not''' add any restrictions on integration, and do not enter any URLs, the individual views of Umantis can be integrated anywhere. \n:* Enter a dummy URL (i.e. a non-existent address) for each field if you want to prevent integration altogether.\n\n===CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)===\nBy default, browsers’ ''same-origin policy'' will not be violated. With [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing CORS], web browsers and web clients can be allowed to make ''cross-origin requests'' . Based on the W3C standard mechanism, the same-origin policy can be circumvented for the following sections of the solution: \n* ''/XMLExport/ID''\n* ''/CSVExport/ID''\n* ''/Vacancies''\n* ''/VacanciesIntraxData''\n* ''/RssFeed'' \n\n====CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing paths)====\nPlease enter your specific paths separated by commas, e.g. \"/XMLExport/ID,/CSVExport/ID\". \n\n====Access-Control-Allow-Origin====\nIn this section, you can enter your specific domain (“<nowiki>https://exampledomain.com</nowiki>”). If you enter an asterisk (“*”) here, cross-origin requests to the sections of the solution listed above will be allowed from any domain.\n\n\n====Whitelisting setting for general redirects====\n* '''URL'''\n: Please specify URLs separated by commas (example: <nowiki>https://www.123company1.com, https://www.123company2.com</nowiki>).\n\n====Whitelisting setting for redirection after logout====\n* '''URL'''\n: Please specify URLs separated by commas (example: <nowiki>https://www.123company1.com, https://www.123company2.com</nowiki>).\n\n; [x] Activate cookie attributes Same site=strict\nWe recommend enabling this option (if not already enabled). If the checkbox is checked, only cookies that have been set by the same page can be read. If a user is directed to the URL by a link from another page, the cookie cannot be set during the initial call. \n\n; [ ] X-Frame-Options - Activate sameorigin\nIf the checkbox is checked, only pages from the same source page (same origin) can be integrated in an iFrame. This security setting is used to prevent pages from being integrated in third-party sites without your permission. If you deliberately integrate pages of your HTM solution in an iFrame in other sites, please uncheck this checkbox (e.g. job board on company website, HTM solution on intranet).\n\n====Whitelisting URL settings for CSP====\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important Notes:''' \n* You can set whitelisting URL settings to determine which URLs should bypass the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy Content Security Policy]. This may be necessary when using external services, such as tracking tools.\n* In general, we do not recommend bypassing the Content Security Policy. If such settings are made, you do so \"at your own risk\".\n* Please note that the \"URLs\" field will only be visible (even in [Configuration mode]) if the \"Enable CSP whitelist URLs\" checkbox has been checked.\n\n; [ ] Enable CSP Whitelist URLs\nIf this option is enabled, specified URLs are treated as whitelist for CSP validation\n* '''URLs'''\n: Please specify URLs separated by commas (example: <nowiki>https://www.123company1.com, https://www.123company2.com</nowiki>).\n\n===CAPTCHA activation===\n[[File:attention.gif]] When activating the CAPTCHA on login screens, it becomes active immediately. When activating the CAPTCHA on application forms, the CAPTCHA must also be set to visible via \"[[Configuration mode]]\". This way it can be decided for each individual application form whether the CAPTCHA should be used for this form.\n\n* '''Enable CAPTCHA for internal login screens'''\n: e.g. login HR cockpit (''/''), login Manager cockpit (''/SelfServiceLine''), login for Committees/Board members (''/SelfServiceBoard''), Third party approver (''/SelfServiceAppraisal''), Vacancy approver (''/SelfServiceApprovals'')\n\n* '''Enable CAPTCHA for external forms'''\n: e.g. application forms:\n: <div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px\">'''External job market (applicants): '''''<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n:* ''/Vacancies/ID/Application/New/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/ID/Application/New/ID/ID'' \n:* ''/Vacancies/ID/FurtherApplication/Apply/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/ID/FurtherApplication/ApplyFromJobAbo/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/InitiativeApplication/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/InitiativeApplication/OnlyApplication/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/InitiativeApplication/ApplyFromJobAbo/ID''\n</div></div>\n\n: <div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px\">'''Internal job market: '''''<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n:* ''/VacanciesIntraxData/ID/Application/New/ID''\n:* ''/VacanciesIntraxData/ID/FurtherApplication/Apply/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/ID/FurtherApplication/ApplyFromJobAbo/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/InitiativeApplication/OnlyApplication/ID''\n:* ''/VacanciesIntraxData/InitiativeApplication/ApplyFromJobAbo/ID''\n</div></div>\n\n: <div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px\">'''Recruiter: '''''<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n:* ''/VacanciesRecruiter/ID/Application/New/ID''\n:* ''/Vacancies/Register/ID''\n</div></div>\n\n* '''Enable CAPTCHA for external login screens'''\n: e.g. login to Applicant cockpit (''/SelfService''), login for External Recruiters (''/SelfServiceRecruiter'')\n\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:''' \n* We have chosen a simple variant for the CAPTCHA feature, as this ensures the greatest possible privacy for you and your data. Many of the more current CAPTCHA options, which look simpler to the end user, work by transmitting the user's data, such as browser history, usage behavior, and more, to third parties to analyze whether the user is human or a potential bot. Privacy is our highest priority, which is why we have decided against such an option.\n* The captcha has no influence on [[SSO - Single Sign On|SSO]], because with Single Sign On the user is redirected to the login page of the SSO server, and then directly logged into his cockpit, i.e. the captcha does not come into play.\n\n==Actions==\n* [[IP range|Enter new IP range]]\n\n==Virus scanner==\nThe Umantis application automatically checks all files that are uploaded (in the background, unnoticed by users). The anti-virus program [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClamAV ClamAv] is used here as a code component. \n\nIf the virus scanner detects a suspicious file or a virus, the user is informed of the situation with an error message and/or failed file upload.\n\n==Changing the email address==\nNote that people registered in the system (user roles in umantis) will receive an email with a confirmation link '''when changing their email address'''. Only after they access this link is the new email address valid and stored in the system. When people are '''newly entered in the system''' by the HR department, a ''verification''email with a confirmation link is sent to their email address. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] No verification/confirmation will be requested for imported email addresses. The same will apply if administrators modify the email address. In that case, it will be immediately regarded as verified.\n\nFor applicants (Umantis Applicant Management), confirming or not confirming the email address has no functional effect; therefore, applicants will not automatically receive a request to confirm their email address. <br> However, if you want the applicants to confirm their email address anyway, you can copy the following link into the email ([[System e-mails#Welcome email for applications|Welcome email for applications]]): \n* ''<a href=\"https://[Special.Hostname]/SelfService?UserID=[Person.ID]&amp;CustomFunction=ActivateMailaddress&amp;token=[Activate.Token]\">Confirm email address</a>''. \n\nIf you work with [[IP range|IP ranges]], you should accept the following paths: \n* for [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]]: ''/LandingPageApplicants'' or ''/LandingPageOther'' \n* for [[Employee management|Employee Management]]: ''/LandingPageEmployee''\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] In the [[Settings for company / organization profile#Email special settings|email special settings]], please fill in the fallback sender address to ensure that the emails that are sent out have the correct (company-specific) sender."

There are also [[External vacancy notice#Adaptive selection lists|adaptive selection lists]], but these are used automatically on the [[Internal publication|internal]] and [[External vacancy notice|external]] job boards, since they do not allow for user-specific configuration.\n\nSince the [[Customize views|field names (like all texts in the solution) can be customized]], the original name is always shown in the list overview in gray text, to the right of the currently valid name which is shown in black. Of course, the wording of the selection lists must fit with the [[Customize views|rest of the solution]].\n\nWhen [[Search functions#Search over selection lists|searching over selection lists]], all higher- and lower-level categories are included. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Entries in the “Special code” column currently only work in Haufe [[Employee management|Employee Management]] for visual customization of the [[Events#Visual configuration of the event calendar|event calendar]].\n\n==Configure selection lists==\nYou can configure selection lists, i.e. you can [[#Auswahlwert hinzufügen|add selection values]], modify them for each language, or delete existing values. \n\nApply the “Edit selection value” action in the view of a specific selection list to edit the selection list values you have selected. \nYou will then see all the available configuration options.\n\nThe order of the selection values can also be configured separately for [[Languages|each language used]]. Each user will see the selection list in their own user language with the appropriate values in the specified order. If the name of a selection value is blank in a given language, then that value will not be displayed in that language. Depending on the list, you can also do the following for each value: \n* assign another selection value to it as a '''parent category'''. It is important to avoid circular references here, in which different values are each assigned as the parent category of the other.\n* assign it a '''code'''. For example, these codes can be used as identifiers for imports and exports (e.g. ISO country codes)\n* '''Dashboard''': The column and field \"Dashboard\" can be shown to define special settings for dashboards there. So you or your designers have another possibility to define identifiers for individual settings besides the columns \"Code\" and \"Special Code\". \n* assign it a '''source system key'''. This is usually the case with [[Imports|imports from different source systems]] (e.g. in organizational units in multinational companies).\n\n* '''External identifier'''\n: The “External identifier” can be defined for selection list values for the application status. This allows you to display a different name externally for a given status. In the applicant access area, you can enable this ''External identifier'' for [[Configuration mode|display]] in the table view of “My active applications”. \n\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Notes on customizing selection lists''' \n* To avoid erroneous behavior, do not use $$ or similar characters when naming selection lists.\n* Selection values that cannot be deleted should be renamed in an informative way, if at all.\n\n'''Certain selection values cannot and should not be deleted, because they are “hardwired” to specific actions in the solution. <br>Examples:''' \n* The [[Change process status|application status]] “Application received” is automatically assigned to all new applications.\n* The application statuses “Waiting for applicant responses” / “Waiting list” / “Evaluation by hiring manager” and “Application withdrawn” are associated with [[Applicant management main page#search links|search links]]. If these statuses were deleted, the search links would no longer work.  \n\n* Selection values for the video interview (“Invite to video interview”, “Video interview done”, “Video interview canceled”, “Video interview expired”) are only displayed in video interviews have been activated in the settings.  \n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] '''Additional notes / information:''' \n* Deleted selection values are no longer available for selection in the selection list; if they are still selected, however, they continue to be displayed with an (X) next to the value. For example, the deleted application status “Invite for 3rd interview” will still be displayed as “Invite for 3rd interview (X)” in the three applications that happened to be in that status at the moment when the selection value was deleted, both in the application overview and in the applications themselves. \n\n* A few default diagrams rely on very specific selection list values (on the IDs of those values), and will only work correctly in the default setup if those values are still present as expected. For example, the analytics value for “Time to hire” depends on the date on which the job status changes to “Filled”. Therefore, this selection list value may not be changed or deleted if you want to work with “Time to hire” in your analytics.\n\n===Final status===\nIn [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]], you can use the “Edit selection values” action for the “Application status” selection list (''/Administration/Dropdown/2/Profile'') to mark certain statuses as so-called “final statuses”. Using a final status is useful e.g. to prevent applications from being resubmitted for the same job (when an applicant withdraws, then resubmits their application for the same job). <br>\n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you check the “Final status” box for one of the selection list values, that value will be treated as a final application status. The direct result is that the applicant will '''no longer be able to withdraw applications''' that are set to a status defined as final. The “Withdraw application” option will automatically be hidden for all applications that are set to a “final status”.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] As soon as an application enters an application status marked as a final status, withdrawal of that application is automatically blocked. The applications are treated similarly to archived applications, and are not visible to the applicant in their profile by default. Only if the search is reset can applicants view these applications.\n\n===Add selection value===\nBy executing the action “Add selection value” in the view of a selection list, you can then enter the following attributes: \n* '''Add entry''' (multilingual)\n: Enter the new selection value in multiple languages in the appropriate [[Languages|language]] fields.\n* '''Code'''\n: Enter the code here, e.g. ISO country codes. \n* '''Name'''\n: You can specify an optional name.\n* '''Parent category'''\n: Here you can specify an existing selection list value as a parent category. In the [[Branches#Application process and Application process configuration|structured reason for application status]], you will find an example of how parent categories and subcategories can be used.\n\n==Export and reimport selection lists==\nWhen making changes to a selection list, you can also export it, modify it in Excel and then reimport it. To do this, select all the selection values and then run the action below it to “Export values to Excel”. You will then find the Excel file in the exports, and you can [[Imports|import]] it again immediately after modifying the values.\n\nValues are assigned in the following order: \n# List ID: not chosen by user – generated by Haufe \n# List entry code: can be freely chosen and serves to identify the list entry as uniquely as possible \n# If “ListenEintrag.Code” (the list entry code) or “ListenEintrag.UebergeordnetCode” (the parent code) have not been set in the import, the field’s content is taken from Listeneintrag.Textdeu. If no value is entered there, then the Listeneintrag.Texteng field is searched. If there is no value there either, then the Listeneintrag.Textfra field is checked.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Lists 66 and 67 (organizational units and matrix organizational units) must be filled in/imported in all used languages, because access control via organizational units takes the user language into account.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Only lists 66 and 67 (organizational units and matrix organizational units) may have source system keys. \nOf course, imports can be done without a source system key in less complex systems. \n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] The '''field code''' is especially important for '''importing selection lists''' or '''assigning master data to selection lists''' in a master data import. Since Code is the '''primary key''' used to find a list entry, Code cannot be modified (written) by an ordinary list import. If you would like to modify Code for selection list values, however, you can work with the '''import variable [ListenEintrag.OverwriteCode]''' when importing a selection list. The import then works as follows: The value is first located in the normal way using Code (old value). Once the value has been found, the overwriting Code (new value) is saved. The Code has now been modified. Import values that search for the old code will no longer find this entry.  '''It is therefore important''' that this import is only run '''exactly once'''. If you initiate the same import again, you will duplicate your entries.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] The following lists are generated by the system and cannot be imported: \n* ID 17\n*55\n*65\n*77 (Languages)\n*100 (Module roles)\n\n==Fixed lists==\nThe subgroup of fixed lists includes all selection lists for which the number of selection values cannot be changed, since they have a functional meaning. For example, the value “Dear Mr.” will be filled in from Liste.AddrFormal at the place in an email where the salutation variable [Empfänger.Anrede] appears, if the salutation “Mr.” has been entered for the recipient. The salutation is also one of the fixed lists (Salutation); it can be changed, but no new values can be added.\nThe administrator can make global changes to the fixed lists here. Please note that fixed lists have a functional meaning, and that any changes made should not affect this meaning.<br>\nFor example, it makes sense to modify the following lists: \n* '''Aggregator''' and '''SetSpecialCWCText''': Sections of the employee review meeting such as “Goals”, “Tasks”, etc. These lists are displayed in the overall assessment, and must be modified if a section has been modified.\n----"

For umantis systems, the details needed for the subsequent Single Sign On on the system are queried directly and the link is automatically generated later. The relevant fields are:\n\n*  Name: Select a meaningful name (example: umantis applicant management) \n*  System no.: ID of the solution concerned (example: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''1234'''.umantis.com or <nowiki>https://employeeapp-</nowiki>'''1234.de'''.umantis.com) \n*  Authentication key: The same key that is entered in the third party system as the <em>Authentication key for SSO (SingleSignOn)</em>.\n*  URL: Only needs to be entered in separate domains (not umantis.com) in the case of third party systems.\n\n\nWith other third party systems the relevant request can be written directly in HTML. In doing this, you can use parameters ([ParamID1] to [ParamID5]) which are then to be populated user-specifically in the request.\n\nFor every user you can then, in the [[Settings in employee file|settings]], create accesses to other user profiles in the third party systems that have been created. Depending on the system, other details that relate to the [[Single Sign On|Single Sign On]] must be entered.\n\n'''Application'''<br /> As soon as at least one access to a different user profile has been created for a user, the change of user symbol [[File:Switch.gif]] appears for this user in the top navigation.\n\nThe user will then find all the links to the accesses that have been created behind this symbol.\n\n==Settings for aconso interface in employee management==\n\nHere there is a more detailed description of how to set up the [[aconso - Digital personnel file|aconso]] interface.\n\n==Settings for LinkedIn interface in employee management==\n\nHere there is a more detailed description of how to set up the [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]] interface.\n\n==Settings for a Xing interface in employee management==\n\nHere there is a more detailed description of how to set up the [[Xing|Xing]] interface.\n\n==Actions==\n*  Create umantis employee management\n*  Create umantis application management\n*  Create third-party system"

For example, if the current holder of a job changes, then the job is archived with the previous holder and a new job (with the same job ID) is created with the new holder. Even though the new and old jobs now share the same job key, the system does not create any link between them. This means in turn that no job history is displayed in this case and that, for example, succession planning is not transferred over to the new job. With the confirmation that job keys are unique, the system will now attempt to establish a link between jobs based on the job key. This means, for example, that the “Previous job holders” for a position can be displayed, or that the [[Function profiles|functional profile]] and [[Succession planning|succession planning]] are retained even in the case of a new job holder, and can be continued for the new job. For this to work, it is the combination of the job key and the source key that has to match.\n\n===Local settings===\n====[[File:divers.png|20px]] List of titles====\nSpecify here which title options should be available for users to select: \n* ''Ms.'' \n* ''Mr.'' \n* ''Various''\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Note that the full list will be made available if you do not make any selection.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''More [[Information regarding third gender|information on the third gender]]'''\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* '''Alternative hostname'''\n: We now offer the option to replace your existing URL (www.'''employeeapp-ID.umantis'''.com) with a customer-specific URL (e.g. www.'''customer-talents'''.com).

External individuals [[Register external persons|register their profile]] the first time that they register for an externally-published event or join a public group.\n\n==Email special settings==\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please ensure that you do not use email addresses of generic email providers (for example, gmail.com, web.de, etc.) as sender addresses within Haufe Employee Management. If you are using a test or demo solution, please ensure that the sender addresses are changed to those domains from which e-mails may officially be sent. This concerns e-mail addresses of users in the system as well as the central sender addresses, which you can define via the e-mail special settings (''/Administration/EMail'') (\"Central sender address for ALL outgoing e-mails\", \"Sender address for automatic system e-mails\", \"Central sender address for outgoing e-mails in case of missing sender address\"). It is further possible to use such e-mail addresses as \"Central redirection address for all outgoing e-mails\", so that on a test or demo solution all outgoing e-mails are sent to a generic address.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Take note of the tips in the [[Security settings#Changing the email address|Security settings]] as well.\n\nYou can configure the following system email settings in your Haufe application:\n\n; Use central sender address for ALL outgoing emails (incl. system emails)\n* ''Sender address''\n: The address entered here will be used as the sender address for all outgoing emails. The original sender address is used in the email as the Reply To address, and overwrites all other sender addresses.\n\n; Sender address for automatic system emails\n* ''Sender address for system emails*''\n:* '''Employee management:''' This address is used as the sender for all automatically generated system emails (e.g. the welcome email). This value can be used in emails and print documents by using the [Company.Email] variable. \n:* '''Applicant Management:''' This address is used as the sender for all automatically generated system emails (e.g. the welcome email) if no dedicated sender address is defined at the branch office level. \n\n; Central sender address for outgoing emails if sender address is missing\n* ''Fallback sender address''\n: The address entered here will be used as the sender address for all outgoing emails if no other sender can be determined. For example, if a user’s email address has not yet been confirmed.\n\n; Central redirection address for all outgoing emails\n* ''Redirection address''\n: If an email address is entered here, then all outgoing emails will be redirected to this address. This is done only if a solution is intended for use as a test solution and processes involving emails need to be tested. No redirection should be activated for live operations.\n\n; Import notification\n* ''Recipient address for import status''\t\n: A notification email is sent to this address when an import has been successfully (or unsuccessfully) completed.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note on changing email addresses:'''\n*Note that people registered in the system (user roles in Haufe) will receive an email with a confirmation link when changing their email address. Only after they access this link is the new email address valid and stored in the system. No verification/confirmation will be requested for imported email addresses. The same will apply if administrators modify the email address. In that case, it will be immediately regarded as verified.<br>\n*Please note that applicants are not registered in the system, and therefore will not receive a link to verify their email address. Accordingly, the hourglass continues to appear for applications, although the administrator can use [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] to hide the hourglass in the applicant cockpit.\n\n==Publicly accessible documents==\nThis section displays all uploaded documents which are publicly accessible and can be downloaded through a direct link. To upload additional publicly accessible documents (as an administrator in [[User roles in Applicant Management#Administrator|Applicant Management]] or [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|Employee Management]]), click on [[File:edit.GIF]] in this section. \n\nUnder the tabular overview of the public documents already added, enter the following information for the new document that you want to upload:\n* '''Title:'''\n: Choose a meaningful title for the document.\n* '''Document:''' ''Browse''\n: Click on Browse to select the desired document.\n: [[File:attention.gif]] Please that the document size may not exceed 10MB. \n* '''Comments'''\n: Enter comments about the document in this field.\n\nOnce you have selected the desired document, click on Add. The document will then be listed in the overview. Click “Back”, then go to the “Publicly accessible documents” section and select the appropriate “Direct link for public download”. You can integrate this link at various places in the system to make the document publicly accessible.\n\n==Alternative job boards==\nIf no Haufe job board is used, then the address of the job board being used (for each language) must always be entered, so that existing links — for example, in the applicant cockpit — can be redirected to that job board. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] Note that when using alternative job boards, you cannot use [[Advertisement layouts|job postings/descriptions]] from Haufe, but only the [[Application forms|application form]]."

						"__text": "[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[de:Social Media Anbindungsmöglichkeiten und Tipps]]\nA social network on the internet is a loose association of people in a web community. Networks in which users create their own content together are called social media. The world’s largest social network is Facebook.\n\nTypical functions are:\n*Post = sharing content: using this function, content such as text, web sites, videos and photos are shared. \n*Like = I like it: using this function, you communicate (to your network) that you find certain content good. It is often also used as a reaction to the posts of others.\n*Subscribe = results: using this function, the posts and further activities of another person can be subscribed to and read regularly.\n\nTip: If you want to refer to a distinct job posting, for instance, use the variable for the job number in the URL '''[Job.ID]'''\n\nURL example: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-IhreID.umantis.com/Vacancies/[Job.ID]/Description/1/Default</nowiki>\n\n----\n\n==Linking Umantis solutions to social communities==\n\nNote that all links must be saved in “https” format in any kind of linking of Umantis solutions to social communities. Please note that Umantis assumes no liability for third-party content. Usage must be in accordance with the conditions of the respective provider. \n\n===Integrating social media with confirmation step (two-stage solution)===\n\nIf you are already logged in to a social network in your current browser session, “Like” and “Share”, which you use for instance in Umantis  job postings, may be implemented immediately. The following (two-stage) solution is recommended for data protection reasons. It transmits data only with the user’s consent: the embedded buttons deactivated online by default are not in contact with social media providers’ servers. Only via activation by the user and their consent to communication with third parties (Facebook, Google+, Twitter etc.) do the buttons become active and a connection is established. The user can transmit their recommendation with a second click. If a user is already logged in to a social network in the same browser, either another window/tab or a pop-up opens in which the text and/or settings can be edited as appropriate. \nBy giving consent, consent to the transmission of data is granted only for this particular website and for the selected service (cf. [http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/2-Klicks-fuer-mehr-Datenschutz-1333879.html heise online]).\n\n[[File:info.gif]] In general, we recommend an integration of social media (e.g. in [[Advertisement layouts|job postings]]) which requires the confirmation explained above as an intermediate step before “Sharing”.\n\nThe following example of a job posting illustrates the already-integrated buttons of social media providers in an Umantis job posting:<br>\n:[[File:Stelleninserat_Social_Media.png|400px|border]]\n\nIn the lower section, [[File:Share_Social_Media.png]] click on the particular provider and you can make further settings in the following screen.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Note when integrating the “two-stage” solution described above the advice in the [[Create advertisement layout|“Create job posting layout”]]article.\n\nUnderlying HTML code section of the solution described above: \n <nowiki><div class=\"share\">\n\t<div class=\"sharetitle\">Share</div>\n\t<div class=\"sharelinks\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-linkedin-square\"></i></a>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-facebook-square\"></i></a>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-twitter-square\"></i></a>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-google-plus\"></i></a><br>\n\t</div>\n </div>\t</nowiki>\n\n\n'''Below you will find information that is relevant for the previous integration option.'''\n\n===Facebook===\n\nFacebook Social Plugin can be integrated using three different ways: HTML5, XFBML und Iframe. The preferred method is HTML5 Integration. Here HTML and JavaScript is used.\n\nThe Facebook modules can be found at: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/\n\nIf a template is to be expanded with e.g. a Like button, the created code can be integrated directly into the HTML code of the respective template.\n\nCAUTION: at the moment, square brackets are not  recognized by our template engine in JavaScript. Thus, instead of the JavaScript recommended by Facebook, the following script should be used:\n\n''<script src=\"http://connect.facebook.net/de_DE/all.js#xfbml=1\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>''\n\n===Twitter===\n\nA tool for creating the necessary JavaScript code can be found here: https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons#undefined\n\nIMPORTANT: Here JavaScript should be replaced with the following request so that it works: \n<script src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\t\n\n===Google+===\n\nA tool for creating the necessary JavaScript code can be found here: http://www.google.com/intl/de/webmasters/+1/button/index.html\n\nImportant: In order to guarantee functionality at Umantis, the option “Parsing” should be set at “Explicit” (in the expanded options).\n\n===[[XING|XING]]===\n\nA tool for creating the necessary JavaScript codes can be found here: https://www.xing.com/app/share?op=button_builder\n\n===[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]===\n\nA tool for creating the necessary JavaScript code can be found here: http://developer.linkedin.com/plugins\n\n=Related topics=\n\n* [[Advertisement layouts|Job posting layouts]]\n* [[XING|Xing]]\n* [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]"

This is particularly suitable for visitors to your job market who cannot identify directly with one job, but would nonetheless like to work for you.\n\n==Activation of speculative applications==\n\nActivation is realized by [[Branch offices|branch]]. To do so, navigate to a specific branch profile in the settings for the branches. Then, under the \"[[Job subscription & Set up speculative application|Set up job subscription and speculative application]]\" tab, you can activate or deactivate speculative applications in the [[External job advertisement|external]] and in the [[Internal publication (applicant management)|internal (Intranet) job market]].\n\n==Select the branch==\n\nIf an applicant files a speculative application via the global job market, the applicant may choose the branch office on his / her own. Of course, only those branch offices are available for selection for which speculative applications have been activated under Settings. It is necessary to show an alternative link via the [[Configuration mode|Configuration mode]] in the global job market: \"Choose a branch for speculative application\". In a first step, this link takes the applicant to the selection of the branch for the speculative application. See also [[Create new speculative application|Create new speculative application]].\n\n==Renaming the \"speculative application\" title==\n\nBy default, in the system speculative applications are allocated to the \"Initiativbewerbung/Speculative application/Candidature spontannée\" virtual job. In order to re-name the title of this job in the solution, proceed as follows:\n\n#  Navigate to the [[Settings|Settings]] and select the branch under \"[[Branch offices|Branch]]\", at which the designation has to be adapted\n#  Then click on the \"[[Job subscription & Set up speculative application|Set up job subscription and speculative application]]\" tab and there click on \"speculative job settings\" (in the menu on the left). Here you can specify the new name that should be displayed in place of \"Initiativebewerbung/Speculative application/Candidature spontannée\". This name is finally taken over for all speculative applications in the job title column.\n\n==Access authorization for speculative applications==\n\nThe access authorization/visibility for the submitted speculative applications behaves according to the branch settings and the respective [[User roles in applicant management|assigned user roles]] of the persons within the [[Branch offices|branch]]. \n\n* [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]]Speculative applications to '''a branch office''' are also assigned automatically to the '''[[Branch offices#Main branch office|main branch office]]''' simultaneously.\n* [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]]Persons who are assigned to the [[Branch offices#Main branch office|main branch office]] thus have access to '''all''' speculative applications.\n* [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]]In addition, a so-called '''branch restriction''' can be made in the respective user profile of a user (see also the explanations on the [[User profile|User profile]]). As a result of activation, the user will only be permitted to '''access the data for his branch''', e.g. applications that relate only to his own job market/his own branch.\n\n==Speculative applications on multi-lingual job markets==\n\nin the case of [[Multilingual job market|multi-lingual job markets]], the mechanism for the language selection for e-mail communication with the applicant is identical to that for the [[Multilingual job market|publication of job advertisements]]. i.e. depending on the languages activated for the speculative application under the \"[[Job subscription & Set up speculative application|Set up job subscription and speculative application]]\" tab, the language that the user finds most ideal is selected and communication takes place in this language.\n\n==Preferences==\n\nIn case of speculative application, the applicant is asked for his preferences in order to be able to forward or select his interests. This data block in the application is displayed accordingly only for speculative applications.\n\n==Recording speculative applications==\n\nSee: [[Create new speculative application|Create new speculative application]]\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  '''Job advertisement'''\n**  [[Internal publication|Internal job advertisement]]\n**  [[External job advertisement|External job advertisement]]\n**  [[Job platforms|Job platforms]]\n**  [[RSS feeds|RSS feeds]]\n**  [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n\n*  '''Job Markets'''\n**  [[Positions published externally#External job market|External job market]]\n**  [[Positions published on the intranet#Internal job market|Internal job market (Intranet)]]\n**  [[Job market for recruiters|Job market for recruiters]]\n**  [[Multilingual job market|Multilingual job market]]"

For users, this means that they do not have to log in again separately to the Umantis solution. \nThe ADFS connection is based on SAML 2.0 claims authentication (Security Assertion Markup Language).\nAt minimum, this requires a server configured for ADFS 2.0. The service can be used after adding Umantis to a trusted site and after successful validation.\n\n'''Details on configuration are provided below, and are available for download in the following document:'''<br>\n\n[[File:info.gif]]  ADFS version compatibility: 2.0 to 4.0\n* German: [[Media:Umantis_Cloud_SSO_DE.pdf|umantis Cloud SSO configuration]] (as of June 2018)\n* English: [[Media:Umantis_Cloud_SSO_EN.pdf|umantis Cloud SSO configuration]] (as of June 2018)\n\n\n[[File:info.gif]]'''Tips for customers who are <u>just starting</u> to work with SSO:'''\n* The login data for existing users works until the first login via SSO\n* In the context of SSO, a new feature in [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]] is that users like HR and managers can log in with their existing user account\n\n==Activation and deactivation==\n* Parameter to activate SSO for a request: '''?v4login=sso'''\n* Parameter to deactivate SSO for a request: '''?v4login=1'''\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> Archive(Single Sign-On via browser certificate (PKI)) <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n“Single Sign On via browser certificate (PKI)”<br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''''Since the end of 2018, PKI is no longer supported'''''\n\nTo enable authentication via PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), Umantis requires the following files/information:\n* The valid CA (certificate authority), as appropriate for the client certificates you are using\n* Ideally, an appropriate client certificate (for support during setup)\n\n[[File:info.gif]]Cannot switch users via PKI <br>\nWhen authentication via PKI is in use, it is not possible to truly switch users, because the user is identified by means of the browser certificate, and a certificate can only be assigned to one user. \nThis reinforces the security of this approach.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note on authentication with the Safari browser''' (error message: ''400 Bad Request'')\n: Authentication is normally limited to IPs within the company. In the Safari browser, however, the user may sometimes be asked whether the certificate should also be used for authentication with access from other (outside) IPs — as with all applicants. If the applicant clicks “Yes” here, authentication cannot take place, and the 400 error message is displayed. If the applicant clicks “No”, everything works as normal and the application process can continue. \n\n“Settings in the Umantis system”<br>\nCheck the box to “Use PKI” in the [[Security settings|Security settings]] under SSO to enable certificate verification for your system. Then select the fields that should be used for identification. For instance, you might choose to skip the validity check for the date by leaving the fields for NotBefore and NotAfter unchecked. For the Issuer and Subject fields, you can also use regular expressions to add restrictions to your check on the text from the certificate.\n\nFor the next step, you can then go to [[Settings in employee file|Settings]] for each employee, or to the [[User profile|user profile]] for each user, then to “PKI settings”, and enter the individual data from their personalized certificate.<br>\nThe fields are named: Issuer, Subject, NotBefore, NotAfter.<br>\nThe data for these fields are found in the user certificate. Make sure that the data conform to the following pattern:<br>\nIssuer = C=CH, ST=SG, L=St. Gallen, O=umantis AG test, OU=IT, CN=ege, emailAddress=admantis@umantis.com<br>\nSubject = C=CH, ST=SG, L=St. Gallen, O=umantis AG, OU=Development, CN=John Doe, emailAddress=john.doe@umantis.com<br>\nNotBefore = 01/05/2010<br>\nNotAfter = 31/31/2010<br>\n \nYou can also read the information into the solution with an import. You must also ensure that the validity dates are each one day less than the date indicated in the certificate.<br>\nEx.: NotBefore in certificate = 02/05/2010 corresponds to NotBefore for employee: 01/05/2010\n\n“Importing the certificate into the browser”<br>\nFirefox: Extras => Settings => Advanced => View Certificates => Import<br>\nInternet Explorer: Extras => Internet Options => Certificates => Import\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" |Wert||Bewerbermanagement||Mitarbeitermanagement\n|-\n|Variable||[[Applicant management|Applicant Management]]||[[Employee management|Employee management]]\n|-\n|Issuer||[User.PKIIssuer]||[Person.PKIIssuer]\n|-\n|Subject||[User.PKISubject]||[Person.PKISubject]\n|-\n|NotBefore||[User.PKINotBefore]||[Person.PKINotBefore]\n|-\n|NotAfter||[User.PKINotAfter]||[Person.PKINotAfter]\n|}\n</div></div>\n\n=Authentication via URL parameters=\nUmantis offers a simple method of Single Sign On integration via URL parameters. Users should be able to use Umantis simply by clicking on a link, without having to log in a second time. To do this, you can set up a link in your intranet that takes people with existing Umantis user accounts directly to the Umantis home page without having to log in. With this approach, your employees only need to log in to get access to your intranet (which is attached for instance to an LDAP).\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please be sure to log out of public computers after using this function. Otherwise, you will stay logged in, making it easier for outsiders to gain unauthorized access.\n\n==Setting up the link in Umantis==\n''(Employee Management example)''<br>\nYou integrate the following link with various parameters: '''<nowiki>https://[CustomerSolution]/?loginparam=[logintoken]</nowiki>'''\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" |Variablen||Erklärung||Beispiel\n|-\n|[CustomerSolution]\n|URL for your Umantis solution\n|<nowiki>employeeapp-0000.umantis.com</nowiki> <br> or <nowiki>recruitingapp-0000-umantis.com</nowiki>\n\n|-\n|[MetaAlias]\n|Your Umantis MetaAlias.

To take a specific example: If a manager joins the company, is checking the box for “Manager in Umantis Applicant Management” sufficient to allow the manager to log in at the corresponding Umantis URL, with no need for the system administrator to take additional steps in Umantis (e.g. creating a user)?\n\n'''Answer:''' Umantis uses SSO '''only for authentication and not for authorization'''. Therefore, you must still perform a user import with the relevant role assignment. Only after a user has been imported into Umantis with the “correct” login name (which is imported from the previous system and compared with AD) will the user be able to log in.\n\n====Password guidelines====\n'''Question:''' What impact do password guidelines configured in Umantis have on SSO? For example: Password guidelines are configured more strictly in Umantis than in Active Directory — do these guidelines actually still apply when data are delivered via SSO, or do administrators need to make sure that the guidelines are consistent? \n\n'''Answer:''' The password guideline applies for all users that sign in with a login name and password. Once a user signs in with SSO for the first time, they are then identified accordingly. From this point on, the password guidelines from Umantis no longer apply to this SSO user, and the Active Directory (AD) guidelines apply instead.\n\n====SSO as Iframe====\n'''Question:''' Does SSO function in conjunction with Iframe?\n\n'''Answer:''' No, this is not possible. Authentication in Iframe is prevented by MS ADFS (cf.: [https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/d72376fd-47cd-415b-a3a6-34e65f149181/adfs-response-header-xframe-option?forum=ADFS ADFS Forum])."

If an update has been applied to the solution between the time of the backup and the time of its restoration, the outdated backup is prevented from loading and an error message is displayed.\n\n==Actions==\n===Perform a backup===\n\nYou can perform various different backups. It may take some time to create the backup file (usually between 5 and 15 minutes). Once the backup file has been created, it appears in the overview of the created system backups. You can now decide whether you also want to save the system backup as a file on your hard drive.\n\n'''The following parts of the system configuration can be backed up:'''\n\n* View configuration (configuration of texts and show/hide behavior) \n* Design & settings configuration (company, modules & CSS design) \n* Communication templates (letter, print and email templates) \n* System emails\n* Export templates \n* Selection lists & competencies lists \n* Specific (fixed) selection lists or competencies lists \n* Wizards\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that publication templates are not included in the system backup (because the links to the publications are lost). Likewise, branch office-specific system templates ([[Welcome and job subscription email|Welcome & Job subscription email]]s) are not part of the system backup.\n\n===Restore from list===\nA backed-up system configuration can be restored if the solution code has not changed since the backup was performed, i.e. if Umantis has not updated the solution. However, restoration across system updates cannot be guaranteed. To restore from the list, click on the appropriate link and then select the desired system backup.\n\nIt may take some time to restore the backup (usually between 5 and 15 minutes). During this time, the corresponding part of the system configuration will gradually align itself with the backed-up version.\n\n===Restore from file===\nRestoring from a file works the same way as restoring from the list, except that you upload the corresponding ZIP file from your hard drive after clicking on the link.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that the file that you choose to restore from must be in [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP-Dateiformat ZIP] format.\n\nRestoration from a file can also be used to take the system configuration from a test solution and reuse it on a production solution. In this case, however, you must make sure that the test solution was only created/updated as a copy of the production solution after the most recent update to the software. In this use case too, then, the backup and the restore must take place within the same update cycle.\n\n===Data transfer between different systems===\n[[File:attention.gif]] It cannot be guaranteed that data from one system can be transferred to another system. Therefore, be sure to always create a [[#Sicherung durchführen|backup]] of the target system '''beforehand'''. \n\nCertain areas may be moved around between different versions (e.g. between Beta and Stable). The only prerequisite is that there has been no additional development in the desired area. \n\n[[File:checkmark.gif]] '''However, the following areas can only be imported if the backup is not older than 6 months:''' \n* View configuration (only possible with same version)\n* System emails (only possible with same version)"

						"__text": "[[Category:Employee management|Employee management]]\n[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[Category:Settings|Settings]]\n[[de:System-E-Mails]]\nAs an administrator, you can access the system emails through the [[Settings|settings]]. Some of these can be turned on and off under [[Email#System_e-mails|email notifications]].\n\n==Configure system emails==\nClick on the title of the email you want to work with, and edit the message and the subject line. If you would like to insert new or additional variables, you can find them with the [[Variables|variable]] finder. When you are done editing the system email, click on \"Save\". You will be taken back to the overview, where you can edit other system emails as desired. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] Take note of the tips/suggestions for using the [[Format writing#WYSIWYG Text Editor|WYSIWYG text editor]].<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] Note that email attachments are limited to a maximum size of 14 MB. \n\n===Tip from consultants: IF condition for comment===\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] To prevent the word \"Comment\" from appearing alone in the email, with no associated text, when no comment is present (e.g. when forwarding an application to a hiring manager), the following condition can be used:\n\n''[IF Message.Kommentar] Comment: [Message.Kommentar] [END]''\n\n==Settings for sender addresses==\nFor the sender address of system emails, you can define both a general sender address and a branch office-specific sender address.\n\n'''Sender address for system emails (in the main settings):'''<br>\nThis address will be used as the sender for all automatically generated system emails, if no dedicated sender address has been provided for the branch office (see \"Email settings\" in the profile settings for a [[Branches|branch office]]).\n\n'''Email (in the profile settings for a branch office):'''<br>\nThis address is used as the sender for all automatically generated branch office-specific system emails. This sender address overrides the email address stored in the main settings as the sender address for system emails. If no branch office-specific email address is specified here, then the \"System email sender address\" from the organizational profile in the main settings will be used.\n\n==Required configurations==\n* If you have set up the solution for access via [[Single Sign On|Single Sign On]], then all [[Single Sign On|links in emails must pass through the page where authentication takes place]].\n* If you have integrated external pages like the job board into your website using an iframe, then all [[Integration & Design#iframe|links in emails must point to the corresponding page of your website]].\n\n\n==System emails and languages==\nSystem emails are offered in a number of languages, and can be configured language-specifically. \n\n;[[File:Checkmark.gif]] Note:\n:Languages for which there are '''no translations''' cannot be configured.\n\n===System emails and languages with no translation===\nLanguages which are active, but for which there are '''no translations''', cannot be configured or set up manually. The corresponding entries in the system email overview do not exist, and must first be delivered separately by Haufe.\n<br><br>\nIf you do use a language (e.g. ''Norwegian'') for which no translation is available, the corresponding system emails will not be sent out. For example, if an applicant has selected ''Norwegian'' as their correspondence language, then that applicant will not receive general system emails. Functions like “ ''Reset password'' ” cannot be used.\n\n===Welcome email for applications===\nFor '''branch office-specific emails''', such as the [[Welcome and job subscription email|welcome email]] for applications, the language of the job board will be used in the email. If no template is available in that language, then the system's default language will be used instead; applicants will receive an email no matter what. Furthermore, these emails only need to be filled out at the head office (assuming that they should have the exact same content everywhere). If a subordinate branch office has no email text of its own, then the system will use the email texts from the head office by default. If the head office has a version of the email in the selected correspondence language, then that version will be used; if not, the default language is used. \n\nFor more information about creating emails (text and HTML), see [[Create e-mail template|Create an email template]].\n\n[[File:info.gif]] No email will be sent to applicants whose application has received the status \"Application incomplete\". In this case, the responsible HR expert must intervene on their own.\n\n==System emails for passwords==\n* If you execute the action [[Send new access data]], the system e-mail ''SystemTemplate_ApplicantGrantAccess'' is sent. \n* If an applicant clicks on the link \"Forgot password\", the system e-mail ''SystemTemplate_PasswordForgotten'' will be sent. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Both system e-mails contain the variable [Company.Name] in the footer, which displays the name of the branch to which the candidate has applied.\n\n==System emails for employee review meetings==\nAs part of the process for employee review meetings, you can customize and use specific system emails (/Administration/SystemTemplates). Presented below are three templates with a brief description:\n* '''Code:''' '''SystemTemplate_Ask4ConfirmationAgreementSuperior'''\n::'''Title:''' ''Employee review meeting: Request to manager to confirm contents of employee review meeting''\n::'''Subject:''' ''Please confirm contents of [Absender.Vorname] [Absender.Name]'s employee review meeting''\n\n* '''Code:''' '''SystemTemplate_Ask4ConfirmationAppraisalSuperior''' \n::'''Title:''' ''Employee review meeting: Request to manager to confirm assessment'' \n::'''Subject''': ''Please confirm [Absender.Vorname] [Absender.Name]'s assessment'' \n\n'''Example: The following email template is sent out when employee review meetings have been modified:''' <br>[[File:info.gif]] In this case, an email is sent to both participants.

Please take note of the different system restrictions on use with mobile devices (file uploads, etc.)\n\nYou will need the following software to access the full range of functionality: \n\n==Browser and operating system==\n[[File:attention.gif]] In general, please note that Umantis does not support any operating system or browser versions that the manufacturer has stopped supporting.  \nUmantis products are optimized for the '''most recent available browser versions''' from '''Microsoft''' (also IE10; IE9, IE8 and IE7 are only partially supported, with restrictions for certain features), '''Firefox''' and '''Chrome'''.<br> Therefore, we recommend that you always use the latest browser and operating system versions in order to ensure the best possible performance and the widest range of available functions.  \n\n'''Supported browsers and operating systems'''\n* Umantis products are compatible with macOS Sierra using the latest version of Safari. \n* Umantis products are compatible with Windows 10 using the latest version of Microsoft Edge. \n* Microsoft Edge and Microsoft IE11 may cause unexpected behavior when compatibility mode is turned on. However, all content should be correctly displayed.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Important notes:''' \n* Browser extensions or settings that enable spell checking and auto-completion of entered text should not be used for security and data privacy reasons. \n* IE7 does not support the typeahead feature (auto-completion of user input in search fields).\n* Support for SSL 3.0 has been discontinued due to the publicly-known “Poodle” security vulnerability. <br>\n\nUsers cannot use '''outdated versions (no longer supported by their manufacturers) of:'''\n* '''browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 6 and earlier)''' or \n* '''operating systems (e.g. Windows XP)'''\nto access Umantis solutions. \n\nNote that these browser and operating system versions are no longer supported on the manufacturer side either (see notes on Windows XP: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14223/windows-xp-end-of-support). For example, this means that no new security updates will be applied. Extremely outdated versions that are no longer supported by the manufacturer represent an avoidable security risk. For reasons of security and compatibility, we recommend that you avoid using outdated browsers and operating systems, and that you always use the latest versions instead.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> '''[[File:info.gif]] For important information on the Windows XP operating system''' (Click on “Expand”) <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n\n[[File:info.gif]] [http://windows.microsoft.com/de-CH/windows/end-support-help Information from Microsoft on this topic]: ''If you continue to use Windows XP now that support has ended, your computer might become more vulnerable to security risks and viruses.

If your Windows XP PC is connected to the Internet and you use Internet Explorer 8 to surf the web after support has ended, you might be exposing your PC to additional threats. Also, as more software and hardware manufacturers continue to optimize for more recent versions of Windows, you can expect to encounter more apps and devices that do not work with Windows XP.''\n\n'''How long will I be able to access Umantis solutions with Windows XP?'''\n:'''Answer:''' Starting in '''September 2015''' (Stable Update), it will '''no longer be possible''' to use Umantis solutions with Windows XP.\n\n'''What happens if I continue to use Umantis solutions with the Windows XP operating system after September 2015?'''\n: '''Answer:''' For security reasons, access from Windows XP clients is not supported. Users with Windows XP operating systems will no longer be able to establish a connection to Umantis solutions after this date, since no HTTPS connection can be made in the first place.<br>\n\n'''What happens if applicants access Umantis solutions with Windows XP?'''\n: '''Answer:''' You can use the following JavaScript example, customize it, and integrate it into your homepage or company website.

						"__text": "[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[Category:Interfaces|Interfaces]]\n[[de:Technische Umsetzung der PMS Schnittstelle]]\nThe Haufe Applicant management offers two types of interfaces to <em>Prospective Media (PMS)</em> in order to advertise jobs on this [[Job platform providers|job platform Provider]] (see <em>Interface: umantis to PMS</em>). Here, we differentiate between a <em>static</em> and a <em>generic</em> interface. The difference is that in the generic interface, sending any job advertising text is permitted, whereas the static interface only allows the transmission of job ID, job title, applicant, and advertising link. In addition, a dedicated (SOAP) interface is supported so that jobs that were created in PMS can be published from Haufe Applicant management (see <em>Interface: PMS to umantis</em>). \n\n==Setting up the PMS interface==\nTo set up the PMS interface, certain information must be set up in <em>Prospective Media</em> and certain other settings must be configured directly in the Haufe solution.\n\n===Settings in Haufe===\n=====General Settings=====\n\nThe following settings must be configured in the general settings of Haufe.\n\n*  '''URL:''' The request to publish an advertisement is routed to this URL. By default, the following URL is used: <em><nowiki>https://saturn.prospective.ch/NJCWeb/services/fastinterface</nowiki></em>.\n\n*  '''Prospective Media Services customer ID:''' Similar to the customer ID in Haufe, a customer has a unique ID in <em>Prospective Media</em>. This ID must be stored accordingly in Haufe and is part of the authentication during data communication.<br /><em>Note:</em> Please check with <em>Prospective Media</em> regarding the customer ID to be used.\n\n*  '''Prospective Media XML:''' For the &lt;u&gt;Generic interface&lt;/u&gt; , that data can be defined in an XML structured document which Haufe has to send to PMS for the purpose of publishing an advertisement. Structure and content can be defined according to the job advertisement requirements. The job data are extracted with the help of Haufe [[Variables|variables]].<br /><em>Note:</em> Work together with <em>Prospective Media</em> to create a new XML, which better meets your needs than the default interface XML.\n\n*  '''Hierarchy ID''' [Optional]: If a user is assigned to multiple hierarchies in PMS, the corresponding hierarchy must be specified in PMS in order to create or advertise a job in PMS. Since there is &lt;u&gt;no&lt;/u&gt; standard field in Haufe for this hierarchy ID, the mapping must be implemented and queried by a user-defined field at the branch office in Haufe, for example, by <em>[Branch office.user-definedText1]</em>.<br /><em>Note:</em> If the hierarchy ID is not transmitted explicitly, this is requested by the system with the help of a form by the user.\n\n=====User-defined Settings=====\n\nCertain settings must be configured for each user who should be able to make job advertisements from Haufe to PMS.\n\n*  '''User security key:''' The security key is required for authentication of the respective user.<br /><em>Note:</em> You will receive the login details directly from <em>Prospective Media</em>. The IDs of those users in Haufe who are permitted to publish advertisements on PMS, must also be saved in <em>Prospective Media</em>.\n\n===Settings in Prospective Media===\n\nThe following Haufe-specific settings must be saved in <em>Prospective Media</em> in order to be able to use the interface:\n\n*  '''User system ID:''' The umantis ID of those users who are permitted to use the <em>Prospective Media</em> interface (i.e. publish advertisements via <em>Prospective Media</em> ).\n\n*  '''Customer ID in umantis:''' Similar to <em>Customer ID for Prospective Media</em>, which is saved in the Haufe settings, the umantis customer ID must be saved in PMS accordingly. In other words, every ID that you can also find in the Haufe URL: <nowiki>https://recruitingapp-</nowiki>'''[CustomerID]'''<nowiki>.umantis.com</nowiki>\n\n<br />\n\n==Generic interface: Haufe to PMS==\n\nWith the generic interface, now any job data can be transmitted to PMS. The information to be transmitted is extracted by with the help of Haufe variables and subsequently structured by XML and sent to a predefined URL.\n\n<h6 id=\"w_hinweis\">Note:</h6>\n\nThe interface sends the data using HTTP '''POST''' arguments, whereby there is no length limitation. <br />\n\n====URL call up:====\n\nThe data for the job advertisement is sent to the following URL:\n\n*  <nowiki>https://saturn.prospective.ch/NJCWeb/services/fastinterface</nowiki> <em>(Default URL)</em>\n\n<h6 id=\"w_hinweis_2\">Note:</h6>\n\nIf required, the default URL can be configured via the settings in Haufe.\n\n====XML structure====\n\nThe information to be transmitted is extracted with the help of Haufe [[Variables|variables]] and subsequently structured by XML.\n\n=====Standard documents=====\n\nThe following standard documents and templates can be used to configure the PMS interface:\n\n*  Default template (xml): [[File:UmantisPMSStandard.xml|UmantisPMSStandard.xml]]\n*  Diagram to validate the XML structure (xsd): [[File:UmantisPMSSchema.xml|UmantisPMSSchema.xml]]\n\n<br />\n\n=====Mapping Haufe to PMS=====\n\nThe mapping between the job-specific fields in Haufe and the corresponding fields on the PMS side is achieved primarily by the following structuring elements: <br />\n\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''FieldNamePMS'''\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;'''[VariableName]'''&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\nThe field \"'''FieldNamePMS'''\" designates the field label on the PMS side, i.e. the field to which the corresponding data from the Haufe [[Variables|variable]] \"'''[Variable name]'''\" needs to be assigned.\n\n<br />\n\n=====Prescribed standard fields=====\n\nCertain fields are specified by PMS and must necessarily be part of data transmission: <br />\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''kundeStelleOwner'''\"&gt;&lt;Value/&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''kundeStelleId'''\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;'''[Stellen.ID]'''&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''kundeStelleTitel'''\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;'''[Inserat.PublTitel]'''&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''kundeStelleSprache'''\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;'''[Inserat.SpracheExternalCode]'''&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\n\n*  '''CustomerJobOwner''': Job owner (can be left blank if author is equal to the job owner, i.e. the following structuring is sufficient \"<em>&lt;Value/&gt;</em>\")\n*  '''CustomerJobID''': ID of the job in Haufe\n*  '''CustomerJobTitle''': Publication title of the job in Haufe\n*  '''CustomerJobLanguage''': Language of the job in Haufe\n\n<br />\n\n=====Optional standard fields=====\n\nOther fields are, in fact, specified by PMS regarding the names, but they are optional: <br />\n<pre><nowiki>\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"</nowiki>'''bewerberLink'''<nowiki>\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;</nowiki>'''[Stellen.BewerbenLink]'''<nowiki>&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"</nowiki>'''hierarchieId'''<nowiki>\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;</nowiki>'''[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]'''<nowiki>&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n</nowiki>\n</pre>\n*  '''applicantLink''': Direct link (URL) to the job advertisement (e.g. <em><nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/Vacancies/[PositionID]/Description/[LanguageID]</nowiki></em>)\n*  '''HierarchyId''': Hierarchy ID of the branch office in PMS (if set up in PMS). In other words, if a system user in PMS is assigned to multiple hierarchies, the corresponding hierarchy must be specified to create a job. If the hierarchy ID is not transmitted explicitly, this is requested by the system with the help of a form by the user.<br /><em>Note:</em> In Haufe there is <u>no</u> standard field for the hierarchy ID of PMS. The mapping must be implemented and queried by a user-defined field at the branch office in Haufe, for example by, <em>[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]</em>.\n\n<br />\n\n=====Customer-specific fields=====\n\nFinally, as an option, it is possible to use customer-specific fields, which are typically based on the following naming convention '''Field_'''<em>ID</em>, where<em>ID</em> is customer-specific or project-specific. <br />\n\n<h6 id=\"w_beispiel\">Example:</h6>\n\nIf a field \"<em>feld_20</em>\" on the Prospective Media page needs to be filled with the external advertisement text 1 (corresponding variable is \"<em>[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext1]</em>\"), the configuration for the corresponding element would look like this: <br />\n\n  &lt;Field FieldName=\"'''feld_20'''\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;'''[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext1]'''&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\nSample XML configuration:\n <nowiki>\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n\n&lt;PMS&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Mandatory Fields --&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"kundeStelleOwner\"&gt;&lt;Value/&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"kundeStelleId\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Stellen.ID]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"kundeStelleTitel\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Inserat.PublTitel]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"kundeStelleSprache\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Inserat.SpracheExternalCode]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Optional Fields - Standard --&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"bewerberLink\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Stellen.BewerbenLink]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"hierarchieId\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- Optional Fields - Customer Specific --&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_20\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext1]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_40\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Inserat.PublTitelMLExternal]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_50\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext2]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_60\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext3]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_100\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Ausschreibung.Txt_ext5]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\t&lt;Field FieldName=\"feld_300\"&gt;&lt;Value&gt;[Stellen.ID]&lt;/Value&gt;&lt;/Field&gt;\n\n&lt;/PMS&gt;\n</nowiki>\n\n====Other documents====\n*  Technical description of the PMS interface (by Prospective Media) (pdf): [[File:PMS_Fastinterface_DE.pdf|PMS_Fastinterface_DE.pdf]]\n\n<br />\n\n==Static interface: Haufe to PMS==\n\nIn the static version of the PMS interface, a specified amount of data elements are transmitted. Job advertisement texts and publication options cannot be transmitted to PMS (see <em>Generic PMS interface</em>). In the process, the data is transmitted using URL parameters, as a result of which there is a length restriction on the data to be sent (255 characters). \n\n=====Note:=====\n\nSince advertisement texts and publication options cannot be transferred to PMS, corresponding advertisement contents are therefore not maintained in Haufe, but on <em>Prospective Media</em> itself. The job advertisement process works in such a way that the job, in fact, is created in Haufe, but the job advertisement is published via PMS. With the publication activity, a new job is automatically created in the background in <em>Prospective Media</em> and the user automatically arrives in the PMS order entry to the first \"job\". The login is implicit. In <em>Prospective Media</em> the media is then selected that will ultimately be use to place the job ad online.\n\n<br />\n\n====Data elements transmitted by Haufe====\n\nThe following records are sent by default from Haufe to PMS:\n\n*  '''Job ID'''\n*  '''Job title'''\n*  '''Applicant link'''\n*  '''Advertisement link'''\n*  '''Job language'''\n\n<br />\n\n====URL call up:====\n\nThe data for the job advertisement is sent to the following URL:\n\n*  <nowiki>http://www.prospective.ch/cfm/fastinterface.cfm</nowiki> <em>(Default URL)</em>\n\n<h6 id=\"w_hinweis_4\">Note:</h6>\n\nIf required, the default URL can be configured via the settings in Haufe. <br />\n\n====URL parameters====\n\nThe following URL parameters are supported with the static PMS interface:\n\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''Parameter name'''\n| '''Description'''\n|-\n| CustomerID*\n| <em>Prospective Media customer ID: Is saved in the general settings of Haufe.</em>\n|-\n| techNode*\n| <em>System user that records the position/order.</em><br /><em>This information is used as an authentication key and is made up of the customer ID and the user security key.<br />In order to be able to write out the position in Prospective Media, in addition to the customer ID, a personal key is also needed which must be defined for each user in his/her settings.

Save and upload the remaining attachments in a second pass.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n===Configuring the Google API===\n====Registering the Google API access key====\n[[File:attention.gif]] Since June 2018, an API key is required to use Google Maps. Customers pay a fee for this access key, and must acquire it directly from Google. If you use Google Maps without a valid API key, the data will be sent with low resolution and with a watermark “For development purposes only” or the following error message: “''This page can’t load Google Maps correctly''”. \n\nThe [[Google API Key|Google API key]] is used to identify the browser application and is required when integrating Google Maps. Google counts all accesses to the API and shuts off access once a certain number of accesses is reached. You can buy more accesses if the application in question exceeds the limit set by Google for 90 days in a row.\n<br>\n\n====Using the Google API access key in the layout====\nThe following HTML snippet can be used as a template for Google Maps integration.\n\n  <nowiki>\n<!-- Google Maps Stuff-->\n<!-- Google API Key should be set! -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp&amp;key=<GoogleAPIKey>sensor=false&amp;libraries=places\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[document.attachement8]\"></script>\n  </nowiki>\n\nThe placeholder '''<GoogleAPIKey>''' stands for the API key issued by Google. The [[Variables|variable]] '''[document.attachement8]''' points to the JavaScript file (directions.js) that is responsible for the correct behavior of Google Maps integration.\n\n<br>\n'''Example of Google Maps integration'''\n<br>\nIf you want to enter the [[Google API Key|Google API key]] in the solution, you can do this e.g. with a user-defined field. In the following HTML snippet, the [[Variables|variable]] '''[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]''' is used to access the relevant field in the solution. The field '''[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]''' is part of the branch office information.\n  <nowiki>\n<!-- Google Maps Stuff-->\n<!-- Google API Key should be set! -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp&amp;[IF Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]key=[Niederlassung.BenutzerdefText1]&amp;[END]sensor=false&amp;libraries=places\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[document.attachement8]\"></script>\n  </nowiki>\n\nThe source code would then look like this:\n  <nowiki>\n<!-- Google Maps Stuff-->\n<!-- Google API Key should be set! -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?v=3.exp&amp;key=AIzaSyB8PYh2EdHLwgYdkW5UO54zDClATrnlRMU&amp;sensor=false&amp;libraries=places\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/Vacancies/4/Description/1?ShowDocument=8\"></script>\n  </nowiki>\n\n===Configuring map location information===\nThe location information (address) that you want to use for the Google map must be present in the job posting layout. Everything that appears in the element with '''''id=\"location\"''''' is read out (using JavaScript) and used to represent the location on the map.\n<br/>\nAn additional element with '''id=\"infowindow-content\"''' defines the information that will be shown in the '''info window'''. In other words, everything that appears in the ''<nowiki><span id=\"infowindow-content\"></nowiki>''...''<nowiki></span></nowiki>'' block will be displayed in the info window on the map. Entire HTML constructs can be presented in this way.\n<br>\n[[File:GoogleMaps_InfoWindow.PNG‎]]\n\nIf no location information is present at all (i.e. if the ''id =\"location\"'' block is empty), then the HTML block marked with '''id=\"default-no-map\"''' will be displayed by default, and Google Maps will not be displayed (i.e. the whole area marked with the element '''id=\"map-panel\"'''; see the section on [[#Integration von Google Maps in Inserate-Layouts|Integrating Google Maps into job posting layouts]]).<br>\n<br>\n'''Notes''':<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] For geocoding (transformation into latitude and longitude), you must enter at least a street and a city or town.<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] Address information can be extracted using [[Variables|variables]] (see the section on [[#Integration von Google Maps in Inserate-Layouts|Configuring location information using variables]]).<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] If you do not want the address information to be visible in the job posting, it must be hidden via CSS. However, the address information must always be included in the job posting layout.<br>\n\n\n\n'''Example: Location and info-window definition with hardcoded address'''\n<br>\nIn the following example, the address information is hardcoded in the source code.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <span id=\"infowindow-content\">\n    Blue Carpet France Ltd\n  </span>\n\n  <span id=\"location\">\n    Rue Montmartre 64\n    75002 Paris\n    France \n  </span> \n  </nowiki>\n\n\n\n====Configuring location information using variables====\n[[Variables|Variables]] can be used to dynamically extract address information from Haufe. For example, if you want to display the address of a branch office, the job posting layout must first use the [[Variables|variable]] in which that information is stored.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n'''Example: Location and info-window definition (full address)'''\n<br>\nIn the following example, the address of the relevant branch office is used to find the location. The complete address of the branch office is displayed in the info window.\n\n  <nowiki>\n [IF Company.Address] \n   [IF Company.Municipality] \n     [IF Inserat.Titel7]<h2>[Inserat.Titel7]</h2>[END] \n     [IF Company.Name]<b>[Company.Name]</b>[END]<br>\n\n     <span id=\"infowindow-content\"> \n       <span id=\"location\">\n         [IF  Company.Address][Company.Address][END]<br> \n         [IF  Company.Postalcode][Company.Postalcode][END]\n         [IF  Company.Municipality][Company.Municipality][END]<br>\n         [IF  Firma.Land][Firma.Land][END]\n       </span>\n     </span>\n\n   [END]\n [END] \n  </nowiki>\n\n\n'''Example: Location and info-window definition (company name only)'''\n<br>\nIn the following example, the address of the relevant branch office is used to find the location. In contrast to the previous example, however, only the name of the branch office is displayed.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <span id=\"infowindow-content\">\n   [IF Company.Name][Company.Name][END]\n  </span>\n\n  <span id=\"location\">\n    [IF\tCompany.Address][Company.Address][END]<br> \n    [IF\tCompany.Postalcode][Company.Postalcode][END]\n    [IF\tCompany.Municipality][Company.Municipality][END]<br>\n    [IF\tFirma.Land][Firma.Land][END]\n  </span> \n  </nowiki>\n<br>\n\n===Integrating Google Maps in the job posting layout===\nThe following HTML blocks can be used to integrate both Google Maps and an alternative to the map in the job posting layout.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <!--Start Google Maps -->\n  <div id=\"map-panel\">\n    <div id=\"map-canvas\"></div>\n    <div id=\"directionsPanel\"></div>\n    <div id=\"button-panel\">\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"startTextBox\" placeholder=\"Start\" style=\"width: 140px;\" />\n      <button id = \"geolocate-button\" onclick=\"geolocateUser()\">\n        <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8\n/9hAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADdYAAA3WAZBveZwAAAAZdEVYdFNvZnR3YXJlAHd3dy5pbmtzY2FwZS5vcmeb7jwaAAAB\n/klEQVQ4T6WTyytEcRTHZ6yIUJQFDUUew9y58767SVlTUyykKMnCgp2xmo2dx8KSslCT2HmvZWEhZpKkiOIPIJIpeXy+t3uR7Jz69jvn+z3n/B73XM9v8\n/v9ZZFIZBSshEKhNnH4q+FweIrVZyf9Yd5YLFZFwjC4B+8UnJqm6ZeIfwD3Bp5AOh6P16lGmm2Q1WAGPJL8zLpMw37WCunRaLQbfoH4DnyAdfRmu1gGMUzCI+st6AkGg5XQ3ztghmGUktOJfgEKNJ3nJOXune+dnXuU7HC9vEG9YrSxRCJRI5\n/mtWgPyueKXRJHIN7BsnbWTvh74JIGhtMgB47RTcXsPoH+BjcrMUtwDjmA5iXuAzdw++5XIN4lFpdWzP1N/CP4bQXtFHc499YRG5SgYsuySsShtzhck+JkMllMg1bVKf6f0UlDckC3bsX4YyAHv+V+Kvw1uDyYduJW/B3WTRVowvQgC3pAvTb+Cbj68Yh5cq5ZOxXTeAj\n/FW5R3XzgCeLWTeA0IbhJ4kbFrNPSnLtr6M5AgQ1S0tUkDTRhF/rONvmHoav4SLk0zHKSKlsIBAJ1kOugADQk41zF0I7S9RXgBtG0szY6ZAotu9gx/UzNJM6TqInUj3PoPiLcDtCdX1izwMpkMkV25U/TbGs8aTRH8ob7N8qnaAk+9XVs2zyeT9dWwuz6h9mkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\">\n      </button>\n      <input type=\"text\" id=\"endTextBox\" placeholder=\"End\" style=\"width: 68px; display: none;\" /> \n      <select id=\"mode\" onchange=\"calcRoute();\">\n\t <option value=\"DRIVING\" selected>Driving</option>\n\t <option value=\"WALKING\">Walking</option>\n\t <option value=\"BICYCLING\">Bicycling</option>\n\t <option value=\"TRANSIT\">Transit</option>\n      </select>\n      <button onclick=\"calcRoute();\">GO!</button>\n      <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n      <div id=\"text-panel\">\n\t<span id=\"text\"></span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- End Google Maps -->\n  </nowiki>\n<br>\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] All defined elements with an ID are used by JavaScript. If the IDs are modified or elements are removed, the JavaScript must also be changed accordingly.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n====Defining the Google Maps fallback block====\nIf no location information is present at all (i.e. if the ''id =\"location\"'' block is empty), then the HTML block marked with '''id=\"default-no-map\"''' will be displayed by default, and Google Maps will not be displayed (i.e. the whole area marked with the element '''id=\"map-panel\"''').\n<br>\nIn the following example, an image will be displayed instead of Google Maps if no address has been specified.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <!-- Default Div: Dieses Div wird geladen, falls kein Element mit id=\"location\" gefunden wurde und somit keine Map geladen wird -->\n  <div id=\"default-no-map\" style=\"z-index: 9999; width: 328px; margin: 0 auto; display: none; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Gallen\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"[document.attachement9]\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <!--Ende Default Div -->\n  </nowiki>\n\n<br>\n\n====Configuring the Google Maps route calculation options====\n[[File:GoogleMaps_Rout.PNG‎]]\n<br>\n<br>\nThe following options define which route calculation options should be offered.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <option value\"DRIVING\" selected>     <!-- replace this comment with your Text for Driving-->    </option>\n  <option value\"WALKING\">              <!-- replace this comment with your Text for Walking-->    </option>\n  <option value\"BICYCLING\">            <!-- replace this comment with your Text for Bicycling-->  </option>\n  <option value\"TRANSIT\">              <!-- replace this comment with your Text for Transit-->    </option>\n  </nowiki>\n\n'''Notes:'''\n<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] Since modes of transport are not parameterized yet, they must still be modified by hand to fit the relevant language preferences.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n'''Setting the selection value that is selected by default'''<br>\nThe '''\"selected\"''' attribute can be used to specify which element should be preselected by default.\n\n  <nowiki>\n  <option value\"DRIVING\" selected>     <!-- replace this comment with your Text for Driving-->    </option>\n  </nowiki>\n\n<br>\n\n====Overview of HTML elements====\n* '''id=\"location\"''': Everything that appears in the element with ''id=\"location\"'' is read out (by JavaScript) and used for geocoding.\n* '''id=\"infowindow-content\"''': Everything that appears in the element with ''id=\"infowindow-content\"'' is displayed in the info window; entire HTML elements can be used here.\n* '''id=\"map-panel\"''': This div is where the Google Maps map is loaded with ''id = \"map-canvas\"'' , and it contains all other functionality in addition to the map.\n* '''id=\"default-no-map\"''': This element is loaded if no element with ''id=\"location\"'' can be found in the layout.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n===Design configurations for Google Maps===\nSince Google Maps (e.g. its info windows with directions etc.) can disrupt the design of the rest of the job posting, it is recommended that you reconfigure its design accordingly. The following excerpt shows the '''CSS'' to be configured.\n\n\n  <nowiki>\n/* ----Google Maps Panel CSS------------------------------ */\ndiv#map-panel {\n\twidth: 325px !important;\n\tborder: 1px solid #558BD5;\n\tmargin: 0px auto;\n}\n\ndiv#map-canvas {\n\tmargin-left: auto;\n\tmargin-right: auto;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\theight: 250px;\n}\n\ndiv#button-panel {\n\tpadding: 6px;\n}\n\ndiv#button-panel input,div#button-panel select,div#button-panel button {\n\tborder: 1px solid #BBBBBB !important;\n\tleft: 0;\n\tposition: relative;\n\ttop: 0;\n\tvertical-align: middle;\n\theight: 20px !important;\n}\n\ndiv#button-panel button {\n\tpadding: 1px;\n}\n\ndiv#button-panel select {\n\tpadding: 1px;\n}\n\ndiv#button-panel input {\n\tpadding: 0 !important;\n}\n\ndiv#text-panel {\n\tbackground-color: #FFA8A8;\n\tpadding: 4px;\n\tdisplay: none;\n\tmargin-top: 4px;\n}\n\n\n/* Google CSS for the directions window */\n.adp-directions {\n\tborder-collapse: collapse;\n\tcursor: pointer;\n\tdisplay: none;\n}\n\n.adp-placemark {\n\tbackground: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EEEEEE;\n\tborder: 1px solid silver;\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tcursor: pointer;\n\tdisplay: none;\n\tmargin: 10px 0;\n\tvertical-align: middle;\n}\n\n.adp-summary {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n\tpadding: 6px;\n\tbackground-color: silver;\n}\n\n.adp-agencies {\n\tfont-size: 80%;\n\tdisplay: none;\n}\n\n.adp-details,.adp-legal {\n\tcolor: #676767;\n\tfont-size: 0.8em;\n\ttext-align: right;\n}\n\n.gmnoprint a {\n\tfont-size: 0.9em;\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.pac-container {\n\twidth: 312px !important;\n}\n\n/* ---END Google Maps Panel CSS------------------------------- */\n  </nowiki>\n\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n* You must make sure that a height and width are assigned to the div that contains the map.\n* The ''Input'', ''Select'' and ''Button'' elements react very differently in browsers.\n<br>\n\n====Integrating directions via CSS====\nIn order for all directions and route information (e.g. public transit stops, intersections/exits for cars) to be visible, the corresponding CSS entries must be modified accordingly.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n==Advanced configurations==\n===Configuring JavaScript functions===\n====Default functionality====\n=====Displaying branch office with marker and info window=====\nThe first time the layout is loaded, the branch office is shown on the map and the info window is opened. To prevent the info window from opening automatically after loading, the following code snippet must be removed or commented out.\n\n  <nowiki>\n\t//open the infoWindow at the end of this function\n\t//comment this out if you don't want to open the infoWindow at end of loading\n\tinfowindow.open(map, marker);\n  </nowiki>\n\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n* This code snippet occurs 3 times in the standard JavaScript code:\n** 1. for the startTextBox\n** 2. for the endTextBox\n** 3. for geolocation\n* The address of the branch office is used as text, but the text to be displayed can be placed in the HTML element with id=\"infowindow-content\".\n* Following a successful autocomplete or geolocation, the starting location is shown on the map with a marker and an info window.\n<br>\n\n=====Google autocomplete on the startTextBox=====\nThe startTextBox supports autocomplete. The placeholder for the startTextBox is “Start” and can be set directly in the HTML. If the '''placeholder= \"Start\"''' attribute is deleted in the HTML, Google generates a default text in the visitor’s browser language.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n=====Calculating the route and displaying information=====\nOnce a starting location has been identified and the mode of transportation has been confirmed, Google calculates the time and distance from the starting location to the assigned branch office. This information is displayed below the input fields. If an error occurs, the error message will appear instead of the information message.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n=====Geolocation=====\nAll HTML5-ready browsers allow users to share their location. The shared information is entered directly into the startTextBox. For older browsers, the geolocation button is hidden by a JavaScript function.\n<br>\n<br>\n'''Notes:'''<br>\n* IE9 and IE10 under Windows 8 block location sharing by a default setting. ''(As of September 2013)''\n<br>\n\n====Extended functionality====\n===== Show circle =====\nIn the JavaScript code, a circle can be displayed to represent the precision of the geolocation information. However, this circle can get very large and cover the entire displayed map with its fill color. After loading the route, the color of the circle can also be changed.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe following settings can be configured for this circle:<br>\n* Show circle after geolocation\n* Change circle outline color\n* Change circle outline transparency\n* Change circle fill color\n* Change circle fill color transparency\n<br>\n<br>\n\n==Also worth knowing==\n===Known Issues (as of September 2013)===\n* For clients with Windows 8 and IE9 / IE10, geocoding is unavailable due to insufficient permissions. \n* Lines in the info window do not always wrap evenly.\n* If the title uses bold formatting, for example, a scrollbar will always appear.\n* Loading times may be longer when long distances are involved.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Advertisement layouts|Job posting layouts]] and [[Create advertisement layout|Create job posting layouts]]\n* [[Google API Key|Google API key]]"

A few of these are presented below.\n====When opening a newly created print document, the Umantis login screen appears====\n: '''Solution:''' This error often occurs in Internet Explorer. This error can be avoided by adding the Umantis URL as a trusted site (in Internet Explorer). To do this, proceed as follows:\n: 1. In Internet Explorer, click on ''Extras > Internet Options > Security > Trusted Sites''\n: 2. Next, click on ''Sites'' and enter the Umantis URL there.\n: Another option:  First save the file locally before opening it, then open it from the target folder.\n====When using the print template, an “Empty file” error message appears====\n: [[File:Druckvorlagen-Datei leer.JPG|border|600px|“Empty file” error message]]\n: '''Solution:''' The square brackets [ ] are missing for at least one variable in the document, and the file cannot be correctly read as a result.\n\n====“File not found” error message appears====\n:[[File:Druckvorlagen-Datei nicht gefunden.JPG|300px]]\n:'''Solution:''' Your document is probably in the wrong format (should be .rtf), or there may be a loop error.\n\n====Variable is not correctly parsed/filled in====\n: '''Solution:''' Check again whether the (Umantis) variable really exists and is written correctly, whether it is used in the correct context, or whether there might be a loop error. Also check the record in the system to see whether the field is filled in there.\n\n====Print template is not available for selection in the relevant section====\n: '''Solution:''' Check whether the access permissions under '''Communication > Template > Select template''' have been set up correctly. Check whether they have been deactivated by mistake, and whether the release for the relevant view has been set up correctly.\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Variables#How do you find the right variable for the right field?|Activate variable finder]]\n* [[Create e-mail template|Create email template]]\n* [[Create letter template|Create letter template]]\n* [[Create print template|Create print template]]\n* [[Record certificate template|Create certificate template]]"

If you want to jump back one field, keep the Shift (upper case) key pressed down and press the Tab key.\n\n|-\n| \n===Quick selections in dropdown lists===\n| \n\nIn the dropdown lists (list fields) you can enter the first few letters of the word you are looking for and navigate like this in the list. You can use the relevant arrow keys to skip one entry up or down.\n\n|-\n| \n===Pressing buttons with the keyboard===\n| \n\nYou can use the Enter key to press the button that is currently selected. In the input screens, the Save button is automatically selected. The selected button can be identified by its dark outline.\n\n|-\n| \n===Click links with the keyboard===\n| \n\nIn the employee directory, you can use the Tab key to jump from one Edit link to the next.  To click the link, press the Enter key. The selected link can be identified by its dark outline.\n\n|-\n| \n===Select multiple entries at the same time===\n| \n\nIn multiple choice fields you can select more than one entry by keeping the Ctrl key pressed down and clicking all the entries that you want to select. If you then want to deselect an entry, keep the Ctrl key pressed down and click the entry again.\n\n|-\n| \n===Use the keyboard to check boxes===\n| \n\nIf you want to use the keyboard to check a box, press the Space bar. The checkbox will then be shown as checked. The checkbox which is active at any time can be identified by a dark outline. You can use the Tab key to skip from one checkbox to the next.\n\n|-\n| \n===Open a page in a new window===\n| \n\nIf you want to open a page in a new browser window, press the Shift (upper case) key while clicking the link to the page. This is ideal when you want to view multiple entries from an overview. The overview remains in the background and the individual records can be viewed in a separate window.\n\n|-\n| \n===Open a page in a new tab===\n| \n\nIf you want to open a page in a new browser tab, press the Control key while clicking the link to the page. This is ideal when you want to view multiple entries from an overview. The overview remains in the background and the individual records can be viewed in a separate tab.\n\n|-\n| \n===Navigate between open windows===\n| \n\nIf you want to navigate backwards and forwards between open windows, keep the Alt key pressed down and press the Tab key once or several times. A small window then appears showing the applications which are currently open. Keep the Alt key pressed down and use the Tab key to select the window you want. Release the Alt key, switch to the window you want, and continue working.\n\n|-\n| \n===Close window / tab===\n| \n\nIf you no longer need the window/tab, you can close this simply by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl key and the W key.\n\n|-\n| \n===Use the keyboard to scroll===\n| \n\nIf you want to scroll up or down on a page, you can do so with the arrow keys. To scroll quickly, use the PgUp and PgDn (Page up / Page down) keys.\n\n|-\n| \n===Problems and error messages===\n| \n\nThe first thing to always do is update the page. To do so, press the F5 key or the relevant language in your browser's menu bar.\n\n|-\n| \n===Copy print preview to Word===\n| \n\nIf you want to work with the information from the print preview in a Word document, highlight the part of the print preview that you wish to copy to Word. Copy the highlighted area with the key combination [Ctrl] + [C] or go to \"Edit/Copy\" in the browser. Then open a Word document and paste the copied section with the key combination [Ctrl] + [V] or the menu command Edit/Paste.\n\n|-\n| \n===Move about in text fields===\n| \n\nYou can use the arrow keys to move the cursor one character at a time. You can use the [Ctrl] key and the Right and Left arrow keys to move the cursor one word at a time. Using the Shift (upper case) key, you can move the arrow keys to highlight text to copy or delete it, for example.\n\n|-\n| \n===Two different roles in one browser===\n| \n\nWith the \"Private Mode\" (private browsing), you can work with two different roles (e.g. administrator, applicant) in the same browser. You can, for example, check the effect of display/hide immediately.\n\n'''Internet Explorer'''\n\nYou can access the private mode in Internet Explorer with the key combination [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [P]. \n\n[[File:Internet Explorer.jpg.png|Internet Explorer.jpg.png]]    \n\n<br /> '''Firefox'''\n\nThe figure below illustrates how you can access the private mode in Firefox.\n\n[[File:Firefox.jpg.png|Firefox.jpg.png]]    \n\n|}\n\n<br />\n\n==Further information==\n===Setting and using favourites===\n\nPopular pages can be saved as favourites in the browser. Thus, you can call them directly and without further clicks. For search results (e.g. applicant/employee in a particular status), click the «Bookmark» link of Haufe at the top right. This generates a URL that stores the search parameters. You can then save this as a favourite and always call it up quickly.  \n\n===Using wizards for repetitive sequence patterns===\n\nFor frequent, repetitive procedures you can set up a [[Wizards|Wizard]]. This reduces the number of clicks and loading times, for example, by jumping directly from one input screen to the next input screen (Jump URL). You can use search parameters (bookmark feature of Haufe) in the wizard.\n\n===Turn off Compatibility View===\n\nIf you use Internet Explorer as your browser, display problems may occur which are due to the<em>Compatibility View settings</em>. In Internet Explorer, this is activated by default. Turn off Compatibility View, to avoid possible display problems: <br /> In Internet Explorer navigate to \"Tools &gt; Compatibility View Settings\" and uncheck the box for \"Display intranet sites in Compatibility View\" and close the dialogue field."

						"__text": "[[Category:Applicant management|Applicant management]]\n[[Category:Settings|Settings]]\n[[Category:Job applications|Job applications]]\n[[de:Initiativbewerbung]]\n\nAn unsolicited application is one that does not relate to any specific job posting on the job board.\nThis type of application is especially appropriate for visitors to your job board who do not immediately identify with a currently available job, but would still like to work with you.\n__TOC__\n==Activating unsolicited applications==\nUnsolicited applications must be activated for each [[Branches|branch office]] individually. To do this, go to the branch office settings and navigate to a specific branch office profile. On the [[Job board settings|Job board settings]] tab, you will then find actions that allow you to activate or deactivate unsolicited applications in both the [[External vacancy notice|external]] and [[Internal publication (applicant management)|internal (intranet) job boards]].\n\n==Selecting a branch office==\nWhen submitting an unsolicited application through the global job board, applicants can choose the desired branch office themselves. Of course, only branch offices for which unsolicited applications are activated in the settings will be available for selection. An alternative link must be enabled for display on the global job board via [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]]: “Select branch office for unsolicited application”. When the applicant clicks on this link, the first step is to select the branch office for their unsolicited application. See also [[Create new speculative application|Create new unsolicited application]].\n\n==Visibility of unsolicited applications==\nBy default, all unsolicited applications are visible from the head office. Administrators can specify in the settings for a given branch office whether unsolicited applications should be visible from the head office or not from that moment on. <br>\nThis visibility setting can be used to indicate for each individual branch office whether its unsolicited applications can be viewed by the head office. To do this, the setting '''''Do not show unsolicited applications at head office''''' must be activated or deactivated accordingly.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] If the box for “Do not show unsolicited applications at head office” is checked, then from that moment on, all '''newly received''' unsolicited applications will '''not''' be viewable from the head office. Unsolicited applications that were received '''before''' this setting was activated (i.e. before the box was checked) will still be visible from the head office.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Under certain circumstances, the visibility of individual fields of the unsolicited application form may be restricted even for administrators. If they are not assigned to the branch office in question, certain fields will not be visible to them. (They are displayed in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], but not after saving.)\n\n==Renaming the “unsolicited application” job==\nBy default, unsolicited applications are assigned to the virtual job “Initiativbewerbung / Unsolicited application / Candidature spontanée” in the system. To change the name of this job in the solution, proceed as follows:\n# Navigate to the [[Settings|settings]]; under “[[Branches|Branch office]]”, select the branch office for which you want to change this name.\n# Then click on the tab “[[Job subscription & Set up speculative application|Job subscription & Set up unsolicited application]]”, then on “Unsolicited job settings” (in the menu at the left). Here, you can specify the new name that should be used instead of “Initiativbewerbung / Unsolicited application / Candidature spontanée”. This name will then appear in the “Job title” column for all unsolicited applications.\n\n==Access permissions for unsolicited applications==\nAccess permissions/visibility for incoming unsolicited applications are controlled by the branch office settings and the [[Benutzerrollen im Bewerbermanagement|user roles assigned]] to people at each [[Branches|branch office]]. \n*[[File:Info.gif]] Unsolicited applications for '''a branch office''' are also automatically assigned to the '''[[Branches#Head office|main office]]''' at the same time.\n*[[File:Info.gif]] People who are assigned to the [[Branches#Head office|head office]] therefore have access to '''all''' unsolicited applications.\n*[[File:Info.gif]] In addition, a so-called '''branch office restriction''' can be added to any user’s profile (see also the description of the [[User profile|user profile]]). If this restriction is activated, the user is only allowed to '''access data from their own branch office''', e.g. applications that only relate to their own job board or branch office.\n\n==Unsolicited applications in multilingual job markets==\nFor [[Multilingual job market|multilingual job markets]], the mechanism for choosing the language for email communications with the applicant works the same way as for [[Multilingual job market|publishing job postings]]. Depending on the languages that are activated for the unsolicited application on the “[[Job subscription & Set up speculative application|Job subscription & Set up unsolicited application]]” tab, the most appropriate language for the visitor is selected and used for communications.\n\n==Preferences==\nWhen submitting an unsolicited application, the applicant is asked for their preferences in order to guide or preselect them according to their interests. As such, this section of the application only appears for unsolicited applications.\n\n==Creating unsolicited applications==\n\nSee: [[Create new speculative application|Create new unsolicited application]]\n\n==Related topics==\n* '''Job posting'''\n** [[Internal publication (applicant management)|Internal job posting]]\n** [[External vacancy notice|External posting]]\n** [[Job boards|job platforms]]\n** [[RSS-Feeds|RSS feeds]]\n** [[Automatic exports|Automatic exports]]\n* '''Job boards'''\n** [[Positions published externally#External job board|External job board]]\n** [[Positions published on the intranet#Internal job board|Internal job board (intranet)]]\n** [[Job market for recruiters|Job board for recruiters]]\n** [[Multilingual job market|Multilingual job board]]"

The structure is always the same: They start and end with square brackets and are called [Entität.Feld].\n\nFor example, to create an email template, insert the Umantis variables at the positions where the recipient and sender data is to be customized. When a letter is created or an email is sent, these positions are automatically replaced by the data from Umantis.\n\nList values such as work experience, goals and selection questions must be exported using [[Loops for exporting lists|loops]].\n\n==How do you find the right variable for the right field?==\nWherever Umantis gives you the option to create [[Templates|templates]], the “Activate variable finder” action is displayed on the left side. Once activated, a small question mark [?] is shown next to every field that can be read using variables. Moving the cursor over the question mark displays all possible variables for that field in a box. Now you can simply navigate through the solution and collect the right variables for the fields. ( https://employeeapp-[KundenID].umantis.com/?switchVariableFinder=on or https://recruitingapp-[KundenID].umantis.com/?switchVariableFinder=on activates finder )\n\n[[File:info.gif]] In Umantis Applicant management you can find a helpful overview of '''communication variables''' under the following URL extension: ''/Contact/Templates/Help''.\n\n==Which variable is the right one for each field?==\nIn general, you will find at least one German and one English version of the same variable for each field. If there are more than two variables for a field, we recommend that you try out the variables briefly for their context, if their potential application is not clear from the name of the variable. For example, the variable for the \"Vorname\" (first name) field in the context of an email template may refer to the sender or the recipient. Accordingly, you use the [Empfaenger.Vorname] variable for the recipient and the [Absender.Vorname] variable for the sender.\n\n==Important recipient variables==\n{|\n|-\n! Use\n! Variable\n!

If no form of address is listed, the condition places “Dear Ms. / Mr.” in front of the name:\n\n''[IF !Empfaenger.Anrede]Dear Ms. / Mr. [END][IF Empfaenger.Anrede][Empfaenger.AnredeFormell] [END][Empfaenger.Name]''\n\n\nIn the same way, the title can be set either before or after the name by setting the spaces correctly.\n\n''[Empfaenger.AnredeFormell] [IF Empfaenger.Titel][Empfaenger.Titel] [END][Empfaenger.Name][IF Empfaenger.TitelNachName] [Empfaenger.TitelNachName][END]\n''\n\n\nConditions can be combined as well:\n\n''[IF !Empfaenger.Anrede]Dear Ms. / Mr. [END][IF Empfaenger.Anrede][Empfaenger.AnredeFormell] [END][IF Empfaenger.Titel][Empfaenger.Titel] [END][Empfaenger.Name][IF Empfaenger.TitelNachName] [Empfaenger.TitelNachName][END]\n''\n\n==Combination of IF and ELSE queries==\nThe following example shows how IF and ELSE queries can be combined:\n\nThis is an example to test <br>\n<span style=\"color:green;\">[IF Stelle.NiederlassungID==1]</span>variation 1[ELSE]<br>\n<span style=\"color:orange;\">[IF Stelle.NiederlassungID==2]</span>variation 2[ELSE]<br>\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">[IF Stelle.NiederlassungID==3]</span>variation 3[ELSE]<br>\nthe default variation for all other cases<span style=\"color:green;\">[END]</span><span style=\"color:orange;\">[END]</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">[END]</span>.\n\n'''Result:''' <br>\nBranch office 1 (NiederlassungID == 1): This is an example to test variation 1.<br>\nBranch office 2 (NiederlassungID == 2): This is an example to test variation 2.<br>\nBranch office IDs of 4 or higher: This is an example to test the default variation for all other cases.\n\nOf course, you can use any other variable as well.

Not only can the video interview be conducted independently of any specific time and place, it also provides an opportunity to get an authentic impression of an applicant’s concrete skills and competencies. Video interviews are especially useful for evaluating applicants who have already been placed on a short list of applicants.\n\n==Overview of the video interview process==\n[[File:Videointerview-Prozess.JPG|thumb|600px|Fig. 1: Overview of the video interview process with viasto]]\n<br /><br /><br />\n{| class=\"wikitable justify\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 1\n|-\n|\nThe process for setting up a video interview consists of two steps:\n* Configuring Umantis and the Interview Suite, and then giving the Umantis user access to video interviews in viasto’s Interview Suite.\n* Setting up and conducting the video interview: First, a video interview project is added to an advertised job. The details for the video interview are specified in the Interview Suite. Once setup is complete, applicants are invited to the video interview; the applicants then prepare their own recordings, which are subsequently evaluated by the HR expert/hiring manager/committee, and the recruiting process continues.\n|}\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n\n=System requirements=\n\nPlease take note of the system requirements that must be met on both the recruiter’s side and the applicant’s in order to ensure that the process runs smoothly. \n\n==Recruiter / HR==\nThe following requirements must be met on the Umantis side, i.e. by the recruiter or HR expert’s system:\n\n'''Browser'''\nTo meet the Interview Suite’s minimum requirements, one of the following standard web browsers must be used:<br>\n* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 or higher\n* Mozilla Firefox 44 or higher\n* Opera 12 or higher\n* Google Chrome 53 or higher\n* Apple Safari 9 or higher\n\n'''Operating system'''\nThe Interview Suite supports the browsers listed above on the following operating systems: <br>\n* Windows Vista\n* Windows 7\n* Windows 8\n* Windows 10\n* OS X 10.8 and newer versions\n\n'''Adobe Flash'''\nAdobe Flash is needed for video playback in certain configurations:<br>\n* Mozilla Firefox versions lower than 30\n* Opera versions before 23\n* Systems with limited video codec support (Microsoft offers an alternative Windows version within the EU, but with limited media functionality)\n\n==Candidate / Applicant==\nOn the applicant side, the following requirements must be met:\n\n'''Browser'''\nTo meet the Interview Suite’s minimum requirements, one of the following standard web browsers must be used:<br>\n* Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or higher\n* Mozilla Firefox 44 or higher\n* Google Chrome 53 or higher\n* Apple Safari 9 or higher\n[[File:info.gif]] The Opera browser is not supported.\n\n'''Operating system'''\nThe Interview Suite supports the browsers listed above on the following operating systems: <br>\n* Windows Vista\n* Windows 7\n* Windows 8\n* Windows 10\n* OS X 10.8 and newer versions\n\n'''Adobe Flash'''\nThe candidate or applicant requires Adobe Flash version 11.2 or higher. Adobe Flash is automatically included with the Google Chrome browser. If a different browser is used, Adobe Flash must be installed separately at the system level.\n\n=Settings to be configured as part of setup=\n\nIn both the Umantis solution and the viasto Interview Suite, certain settings must be configured so that a connection can be established between the two systems. This is based on certain login data for the VI Suite which must be entered in the Umantis solution.\n==Settings in Umantis==\n[[File:umantis logo.JPG]] We recommend that you follow the procedure below after obtaining the login data for your viasto account:\n\n# '''Entry in the settings:''' The following general settings must be configured in Umantis under ''Settings > Interfaces > Third-party systems > Settings for Interview Suite'':\n#* '''Viasto company ID''': The customer’s ID with viasto. \n#* '''Viasto company name''': The customer’s name with viasto. This normally corresponds to the subdomain for the customer’s viasto portal (e.g. if the URL were <nowiki>https://fanergy.interview-suite.com</nowiki>, then the subdomain or '''viasto company name''' would be ''fanergy''). \n#* '''URL''': Defines the interface URL for the viasto Interview Suite. Make sure that the URL entered here '''ends with a “/”'''. Usually <nowiki>https://interview-suite.com/api/v3/</nowiki>.\n#* '''Is active''': Next, activate the video interview function by checking this box so that the associated functions will be made available.\n# '''Entry in the user settings:''' All users for whom video interviews are to be set up must have the appropriate viasto '''login data''' entered in their user settings (so the viasto account must already exist). Please make sure that the '''username''' is entered here, and not the login name (same as the email address).\n\n=Procedure for assigning a video interview to a job=\nYou can use the Umantis solution to add video interview projects to individual published jobs. When you do this, you will be automatically taken to the viasto platform to enter specific details about the video interview. However, candidates are then invited from within Umantis itself. To ensure a successful video interview, please observe the ordering and instructions given below.\n\n==Umantis: Adding a video project:==\n[[File:umantis logo.JPG]] Once you have successfully [[Viasto video interview#Settings in Umantis|set up the configuration for viasto]], you can [[Vacancy notice (applicant management)|publish a job]] as usual. ([[File:attention.gif]] Please note that the job title may not contain more than 70 characters — otherwise, the video project cannot be created.) <br>After entering the details about the job, you can select the “Add video interview project” option under the “Selection criteria” tab (you must make sure to [[Customize views|enable this section for display]]). A new tab with a login window opens up, which you must use to log in with your viasto Interview Suite login credentials. Through the connection with viasto, an empty project with the specified job title is automatically created, and you can then complete that project in the interview suite.\n\n==Umantis: Archive video interview project==\n[[File:info.gif]] From your Umantis solution, you can execute an action to “Archive the video interview project”. Please note that the video project cannot be reactivated after archiving.\n\n==interview suite: Setting up the interview==\n[[File:viasto logo.JPG]] After a new project has been automatically created with the job you are trying to fill, you can specify the following criteria in the Interview Suite:\n* '''Project name, Internal job ID:''' The project name is copied over directly from Umantis, but the Internal job ID still has to be added manually.\n* '''Project language:''' The available choices are German and English. This determines the language used in emails to the candidate. The language used by Interview Suite automatically adapts to the user’s browser settings.\n* '''Add administrators/users:''' You can use drag-and-drop here to assign users of your viasto solution the user rights required for the video interview for this job.\n* '''Contact:''' Person who should be contacted and/or who is responsible for setting up the video interview (only project administrators can be selected).\n* '''Video upload:''' Here you can upload a video introducing your advertised job.\n* '''Default interview period:''' Number of days on which the applicant should be available to record their video application.\n* '''Evaluators and observers:''' Users can be assigned via drag-and-drop to an evaluator or observer role. An evaluator can evaluate the completed interview, while an observer only has the right to view the interview.\n* '''Criteria:''' Used to create specific evaluation criteria that should be taken into consideration when evaluating the applicant.\n* '''Questions:''' This form specifies the questions that the applicant should answer in the interview. You can also indicate how much time the applicant has to answer the question (preparation time and answer time). These two times can be displayed to applicants when recording your video by selecting “public”. All of the previously defined criteria, or individually selected criteria, can also be made visible to applicants in whatever combination you choose.\n\nNext, clicking on “Overview” will take you to the project overview.  \n\n[[File:Info.gif]] By clicking on “Show preview of candidate home page” in the project overview, you can see how the user interface looks from the applicant’s perspective.<br>\n[[File:Info.gif]] If you would like to change your previously configured settings, click on “Edit master data”.\n\n==Umantis: Invite candidates to video interview==\n[[File:umantis logo.JPG]] If applicants need to be invited to the video interview, simply navigate as usual to the job to be filled and click on the “Applicants” tab. One of the options you will see there is the multiple action “Invite to video interview”.\nWhen you select this option, the applicant will be invited by email. His or her name is then automatically displayed in the Interview Suite under the heading “Candidates”. At the same time that the email is sent, a viasto user account is generated for the candidate, and a link to the account is then emailed to the applicant. When a candidate visits the link, they can complete their personal information form and specify their login password. The candidate must also confirm the terms of use in order to receive access to the viasto solution.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] Because the email is generated and sent from the Interview Suite, the outgoing mail does not appear in the communication history for the applicant. However, the applicant status in the applicant overview will adjust itself accordingly.\n\nAfter registering, the applicant can then complete the video interview independently. The current status of the interview is then sent directly to Umantis via SOAP and the synchronized applicant status, along with the corresponding icons in the applicant overview (within a job), provides information about the current status of the interview.\n:[[File: VI eingeladen.png]]  The applicant has been '''invited''' to the video interview.\n:[[File: VI durchgeführt.png]]  The video interview has been '''completed''' by the candidate and is now available to be viewed and assessed.\n:[[File: VI abgebrochen.png]]  The applicant has '''declined''' to participate in the video interview, or the period for completing the interview has '''expired'''.\n\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Notes:''' <br> \n* The authentication key for the SOAP interface (enter in Umantis: ''Settings > Main settings > Organizational profile [[File:edit.GIF]] > Authentication key for automated import'') must be communicated to viasto before the account is set up in the Interview Suite.\n\n==Umantis: Evaluating candidates==\n[[File:umantis logo.JPG]] The designated persons (evaluators and observers) are notified by email as soon as the applicant has completed the interview. The interview can then be viewed in the Interview Suite. Authorized persons can evaluate the candidate’s video interview in the relevant areas of the applicant profile in the Umantis solution.\n<br />[[File:Info.gif]] The evaluation can be done either in Umantis or in the Interview Suite. However, we recommend the first of these options, so that the application process can then resume directly via Umantis.\n\n*Other detailed information: [[Media:Best Practice Videointerview v12.pdf|Best practices for viasto Interview Suite]]\n\n=The video interview process from the applicant’s perspective=\n[[File:viasto logo.JPG]] Once the candidates have been invited via Umantis, they receive an email with a link to the Interview Suite. There, they choose their login password. Applicants must also confirm the terms of use in order to receive access to the viasto solution.<br>\nOnce they have successfully logged in, candidates can complete their viasto profile (photo, more details about themselves, etc.), read interview tips or watch a video tutorial about preparing for the interview in a professional manner. The candidate can already see certain questions before the interview starts, if you have chosen to make them visible.\n\nAfter an applicant has recorded their interview, they will receive an email notification informing them that their access has been deactivated.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] The applicant interview can only be recorded once, and the recording may not be interrupted.\n\n=Important notes=\n* '''No branch office-specific VI projects:''' The settings for the viasto interface refers to the Umantis solution as a whole and is currently not able to be configured in a location-specific manner.\n* '''Languages in the viasto Interview Suite:''' The language in the viasto solution is based on the user’s browser settings. However, the language of the emails that are sent out is determined by the project language specified in the project settings.\n* '''Deleting candidates and video interviews:''' Candidates and their video interviews are not automatically deleted or archived by Umantis. Sensitive applicant data should therefore be explicitly deleted in the Interview Suite, in order to ensure compliance with data protection policies.\n* '''“Application Status” selection list''': If the video interview has been [[#Einstellungen in umantis|activated]] in the settings, additional values are shown in the “Application status” selection list: “Invited to video interview”, “Video interview completed”, “Video interview canceled”, “Video interview expired”\n\n=Status mapping between umantis and viasto=\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=80%\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightblue\"| Code\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightblue\"| umantis status\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightblue\"| Comment / Note / Meaning\n|-\n!

The video interview project must first be [[Viasto video interview#Procedure for assigning a video interview to a job|set up]].\n:* No email address and/or first or last name has been entered for an applicant.\n:* The applicant has already been invited to the video interview.\n\n===Error message: The video interview project could not be created.===\n:This error message is displayed when you click on “''Add new video interview project''”. \n\n:'''Possible causes:'''\n::* There is a project in viasto that was created independently of the Umantis interface. When this project is now associated to a job, an error message states that “''The video project could not be created''”.\n::: '''Workaround''': Copy the job and create the project again through the Umantis interface.\n::* User wants to create a project, but has either no viasto account settings or the wrong ones.\n::: '''Workaround''': Modify the viasto account settings as needed.\n\n=Related topics=\n*[[Job description (applicant management)|Job description (Applicant Management)]]<br />\n*[[Approving jobs|Approving jobs]]<br />\n*[[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]]<br />\n*[[Publish vacancy|Publishing a job]]<br />\n*[[Applications / Applicants overview|Applications/Applicants overview]]<br />\n*[[IPM integration|IPM integration]]\n*[[CV parsing|CV parsing]]\n*[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]\n*[[Xing|Xing]]\n*[[Aconso - Digital personnel file|Aconso — Digital personnel files]]\n*[[Job board provider|Job platform providers]]"

Using an analytic tool, you can find out where visitors are coming from, which areas of a page are being visited, and how often and for how long various sub-pages and categories are being viewed.\n\n__TOC__\n\nThe settings for web tracking can be found in Haufe under:\n* '''Applicant Management''': ''Settings > Main settings > Organization profile > Settings for web tracking and web crawlers''\n* '''Employee Management''': ''Settings > Main settings > Company > Settings for web tracking and web crawlers''\n\n===Web tracking via Google Analytics===\n[[File:attention.gif]] ''If you use a different configuration from the default described below or another analytic tool, please contact your Haufe representative or our'' [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com Customer Service].\n\nAdministrators can enter a '''Google Analytics Tracking ID''' here. If you have stored your Google Analytics Tracking ID here and activated tracking for your selected URL ranges, '''umantis will automatically generate an associated tracking code snippet''' and integrate it into the header view of the pages you select. This lets you use Google Analytics to collect data about user activity on the Haufe pages of your choice.<br>\n\n'''Finding your Google Analytics Tracking ID'''\n* Log in to Google Analytics with your account\n* Click on “Admin”\n* Select an account from the menu in the “Account” column\n* Select a property from the menu in the “Property” column\n* Under “Property”, click Tracking Info > Tracking Code\n* Your tracking ID and property ID are displayed at the top of the page \n\n'''(De)activation for URL ranges'''\n* To include a URL range, enter the initial portion of the URL, e.g.: /Jobs/All\n* If you enter “/” here, all pages will be included\n* If you want to exclude certain ranges, place a “-” before the URL, e.g.  -/Jobs/All\n\n\n[[File:Google_Analytics_Tracking_EN.PNG|600px|border]]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:''' \n* Umantis will integrate the tracking code snippet with your web tracking ID into the header area of the pages you select. \n* To '''include''' a URL range, enter the initial portion of the URL under which you would like to track user activity via Google Analytics. If you enter ‘/’ here, all pages will be included. \n* If you would like to '''exclude''' certain sections, you can place a minus sign (‘-’) before the URL. It is important to start with the URL ranges you want to exclude. \n* The URL ranges to be excluded must be more specific than the ones you want to include; otherwise, all URL ranges to be included would be covered by the more general scope that you want to exclude, thereby canceling out the attempt to include them. \n* If a URL includes IDs like /Jobs/1, please replace the specific ID with the neutral placeholder ‘ID’ (e.g. /Jobs/ID). Separate multiple URL ranges with a comma, but without spaces or line breaks.\n* Examples: '/SelfService,/Jobs,/Vacancies' or '-/SelfServiceBoard,-/SelfServiceLine,/SelfService'.\n\n'''Anonymizing IP addresses'''<br>\n* You have the option to anonymize your users’ IP addresses, and therefore all data stored via Google Analytics. This function allows you to comply with your company’s own privacy policy rules or those of the data protection authorities in certain countries, if those rules prohibit you from storing full IP addresses.  \n* More detailed information on anonymizing IP addresses in Google Analytics can be found [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=de here].\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:'''\n* Note that you must start with the URL ranges you want to exclude, and that these ranges must be more specific than the ones you want to include; otherwise, all the URL ranges you want to include would actually be excluded as part of the more general URL range being excluded. \n* If a URL includes IDs like “/Jobs/1”, replace the specific ID (in this case the “1”) with the neutral wildcard “ID”, e.g.: “/Jobs/ID”. Separate the different URL ranges with a comma, but without spaces or line breaks. \n* Examples: URLs to include: '/SelfService,/Jobs,/Vacancies' or URLs to exclude: '-/SelfServiceBoard,-/SelfServiceLine,/SelfService'\n* Please note that '''until the new 2018 design is activated''', it will still be possible to enter an '''individual tracking code snippet''' (as described below).  \n:* [[File:attention.gif]] Until the new 2018 design is activated, it is possible for two conflicting snippets to be activated at the same time if the configuration is incorrect. Therefore, we recommend that you immediately switch to using web tracking solely through Google Analytics, as described above. \n\n----\n\n==Tracking code snippet==\nIn the Haufe settings (''/Administration/WebTrackingSettings''), you have the option to enter a piece of code known as a web tracking code snippet. The tracking code snippet is integrated in the header view of each Haufe default page. The code snippet allows for tracking of the pages that include it.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] The tracking snippet should not be larger than 10 kB, as the header size is limited to a maximum of 16 kB.\n\n==Setting up the web tracking code==\n====Example (Google Analytics)====\n=====[[File:Info.gif]] Note:=====\nOnce you have set up a Google Analytics account, you can automatically generate the necessary tracking code snippet. The tracking code snippet is then stored in Haufe. Once web tracking is '''activated''' in your Haufe solution, the pages that use the snippet are “tracked” (i.e. monitored).\n\n'''Step 1:''' First, search for the tracking code snippet for your property. Sign into Google Analytics and click on “Administrative Tools”. In the Account and Property columns, select the property that you are currently editing. Click on Tracking information / Tracking code.\n\n'''Step 2:''' A field will open with a few lines of JavaScript. This is your tracking code snippet. It starts with <script> and ends with </script>.\nThe tracking code contains a unique ID that belongs to each Google Analytics property. [[File:Info.gif]] Do not mix up tracking code snippets for different properties, and do not use this tracking code snippet again for multiple domains.\n\n'''Step 3:''' Copy the snippet. ('''Tip:''' To be safe, you can paste a copy of the snippet into a text editor before proceeding.) \n\n'''Step 4:''' Insert your (completely unchanged) snippet into the appropriate view of Haufe. \n\n'''Step 5:''' Check your configuration. Make sure that the tracking snippet installed on your website matches the code displayed.\n\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Note:''' An invalid tracking code snippet can cause the solution to malfunction.\n\n=====Example:=====\nThe following tracking code snippet shows an example of web tracking using Google Analytics:\n <nowiki>\n <!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->\n <script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=[CustomerTrackingID]\"></script>\n <script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n  gtag('config', '[CustomerTrackingID]');\n </script>\n </nowiki>\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' Reference URL: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs\n\n====Example (Haufe default page):====\nThe snippet generated by Google Analytics (see above) is inserted at the appropriate place in Haufe. Next, check the box for “Activate web tracking”.<br>\n[[File:Individuelles Web-Tracking.PNG|500px|border]]<br>\n\n====Possible analytics options====\n*Where did the visitor come from on their way to the job board?\n**Web tracking must be used on the job board\n**Analytics are performed by analyzing the “referrer” \n*Where did the visitor come from on their way to the application form?\n**Web tracking must be used on the job board\n**Analytics are performed by analyzing the “referrer”\n\n==Restrict web tracking to external sites==\nUsing the option to '''Integrate tracking code snippet in external sites only''', you can restrict web tracking to external sites only. In this case, the tracking code snippet is integrated only into the header view of the external default pages in Haufe.\n\n====External pages====\nThe following pages, among others, are considered as external pages:\n* '''Applicant view''' (public view)\n** Job boards (internal & external) (''/Jobs/...'' and ''/VacanciesIntraxData/...'')\n** Job postings and application forms\n** Applicant cockpit (''/SelfService/...'')\n** ...\n* '''Manager view''' (''/SelfServiceLine/...'')\n* '''Committees view''' (''/SelfServiceBoard/...'')\n* '''Recruiter view''' (''/SelfServiceRecruiter/...'')\n* '''Third parties view''' (''/SelfServiceAppraisal/...'')\n\n====Internal pages====\nThe internal pages are then defined by the view that is provided for the '''HR expert'''.\n\n=====[[File:Info.gif]] Note:=====\nTracking '''internal pages''' can be useful if, for example, you wish to analyze the user behavior of internal users — e.g. to optimize the system using the analytics and information gained.\n\n==Web tracking via Econda Analytics==\n; □ Enable Econda web tracking.\nPlace a check mark here because: By agreeing to use Econda, you are helping us to better tailor newly developed functions and features to your needs in the future.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Econda web tracking allows us to collect data about your use of our system. The data is of course '''anonymous''' and is '''only used by us internally'''. Collecting this data allows us to optimize and develop our product.\n\n==Exclusions for web crawlers==\nYou can use the '''robots.txt''' file to ensure that certain pages in your Haufe solution cannot be found by so-called web robots (also known as web crawlers). The robots.txt file is a text file in an easily readable format. Each line consists of two fields separated by a colon. The first line describes the web robot (here: User-agent) that is targeted by the rules in the rest of the file. Each excluded URL has its own line with the disallow command (here: Disallow). Empty lines are only allowed above user-agent lines. \n* For example, if you specify ''User-agent: *'', then the restriction will apply to '''all''' web robots. Below that, you could then choose to disallow ''/Public/Courses'' if you do not want web robots to find publicly advertised events (Haufe [[Employee management|Employee Management]]): \n User-agent: *\n Disallow: /Public/Courses\n\nIn order to target only certain specific web robots, enter the name of the corresponding user-agent: \n User-agent: googlebot\n Disallow: /Public/Courses\n\n[[File:info.gif]] To verify which pages are now unfindable for which web robots, you can call the URL extension (''<nowiki>https://CUSTOMER.umantis.com</nowiki>'')'''/robots.txt''' in a browser. You should then be able to see the information entered in the robots.txt view of your Haufe solution, i.e. user-agent and disallow page. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] Entering “Disallow: /” would block web robots for the entire solution.\n\n\n; Example for web robot restriction for the job board (Haufe [[Applicant management|Applicant Management]])\n[[File:robots.png|500px|border]]\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Technical integration of Google Maps|Google Maps]]\n\n==Was this information helpful?==\nSend us your feedback and tell us how we can improve our Online Help: [mailto:ivan.seric@haufe.com?subject=OnlineHelp%20%5BWebTracking%5D&body=Please%20give%20us%20short%20feedback,%20how%20we%20can%20improve%20our%Online-Help.

To do this, go to “Configure view” and click on the link you want to add via [[File:Config.gif]]; once there, \n\nenter the link title in the FixedText English field, and enter the following in the Link Target field: “/Wizard/[NUMBER]”\n\nor, if no Link Target is available, simply enter the full link with HTML in the Original content / FixedText English field:\n\n:<nowiki><a href=\"https://employeeapp-[KUNDENID].umantis.com/Wizard/[NUMMER]\">Manager assessment and release</a></nowiki>\n\nFirst, check which ID the desired wizard uses.\n\n==Tips from consultants==\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] When you start creating a new wizard, log in to Umantis twice: once as an admin in order to create the wizard, and once as a user in order to see the desired pages and so that you can copy the URLs without having to switch pages. This also helps you to avoid including pages and views that are not accessible for non-administrators.\n\n===Preselecting a multiple action===\nWithin a wizard, it is possible to preselect the action to be taken in an overview.\nTo do this, you need to identify the ‘value’ of the desired multiple selection in the HTML code. Then enter this for the “MultiActionPreSelection” parameter in the wizard step.\n\nFor example, the following link will select all employees in the employee overview and pre-select the action “Send email(s) from template”:\n\n''/Employment/Current?searchLink=1&fas44001=1&checked44001=1&MultiActionPreSelection=PositionsList_Contact_SendEmail''\n\nWith an additional search so that only active direct subordinates are selected:\n\n''/Employment/Current?searchEntitySubtype=PositionType_Position&searchDirectReportsVar2=1&Search=1&fas44001=1&checked44001=1&MultiActionPreSelection=PositionsList_Contact_SendEmail''\n\nAlternatively. for the employee review meeting overview:\n\n''/Employment/ProzessA?searchDirectReportsVar2=1&searchEntitySubtype=PositionType_Position&Search=1&fas142729=1&checked142729=1&MultiActionPreSelection=PositionsProcessListA_Contact_SendEmail''\n\n==Actions==\n* [[Create new wizard|Create new assistant]]\n\n==Excerpts from webinars about wizards==\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-1.swf|General/Creating a simple wizard (70 min)]]<br>\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-4.swf|Integration (25 min)]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-3.swf|Second example (36 min)]]<br>\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-2.swf|Wizard with multiple entities (25 min)]]<br>\n* [[File:Movie.gif]] [[Media:Webseminar_BM_September_2009_Assistenten-5.swf|Questions (14 min)]]<br>"

The interface lets the applicant generate their own CV/résumé data directly from their XING profile, or download them as a file to their local computer. The résumé that is generated in this way can them be uploaded to the application form. This interface can be used for both the [[Jobs (employee management)|internal job board]] and the [[Vacancies (applicant management)|external job board]]. Since mobile devices (e.g. cell phones and tablets) do not always provide a file system that can be used to upload files, the URL to the applicant’s public profile is also added to the application. This allows the HR expert to access the applicant’s résumé data directly from Umantis.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The settings for the XING interface can be found in Umantis under: ''Settings > Interfaces > '''Settings for XING interface''''' (''/Administration/Interfaces/XINGSettings'') \n==Set up interface==\nThe interface can be set up with a “normal” account. Information that should be displayed to the applicant can be specified directly as part of the setup process. The person that set up the interface can also link the interface with another person with a request to XING. \n\nFollow the step-by-step instructions below to set up the XING interface:\n\n# '''Set up developer account''' <br>Open the page at https://dev.xing.com and click “Login”. Log in with your developer account, or create a new XING developer account. Note that the developer account is '''not''' the same thing as your “normal” XING account.\n# '''Send data to XING''' <br>Send the following personal information (for the developer account) by email to [mailto:b2b-support@xing.com XING]: \n#* Recipient’s ''first and last name''\n#* ''Link to the person’s [https://www.xing.com/profile XING profile]''\n# '''Data processing by XING''' <br>XING will process the request internally, and then notify the person (requester) by email. <br>After receiving the notification from XING, the requester will then be able to see the application in their [https://dev.xing.com/applications/dashboard My Apps Dashboard] (log in as described in point 1).\n# '''Get a production key''' \n#* After receiving the notification from XING, log in to your developer account and fill out the form to “Get a production key”. Explain the intended use in your description (e.g. ''We are using Umantis Applicant Management and want to use the XING interface in application forms in order to further optimize our application process [...]'' or similar) <br> This helps to reduce follow-up questions. <br>The “'''Callback domain'''” field is very important when filling out the form. In this field, you enter the name of your Umantis software, e.g. <nowiki>http://recruitingapp-12345.umantis.com</nowiki>. Be very careful to ensure that the URL you enter here starts with '''<nowiki>http://</nowiki>''' and not http'''s'''://, or else the XING interface will not work. \n#* Read the Terms and Conditions, accept them and then click “Submit”.\n#* You will receive your first production key via email soon afterward.\n#* The second production key will arrive a few days later (after review by XING). This may take anywhere from a few days to a maximum of two weeks.\n#* Replace the test keys with the new production keys.\n# '''Settings in Umantis:'''\n#* '''Settings for XING interface''' (''/Administration/Interfaces/XINGSettings''): Enter the appropriate '''Consumer key''' and '''Consumer secret''' here. When saving is complete, you will see a '''message''' indicating whether the XING interface was set up correctly, or whether any problems have occurred during setup.\n#* You may see any of the following '''messages''' here: \n::: ''XINGAPICALL201'': XING API: 201 Created — The XING API (application program interface) can be reached with the API keys that were provided.\n::: ''errorXINGAPICall401'': XING API: 401 Unauthorized — The most likely cause of this error message is invalid API keys.\n::: ''errorXINGAPICall403'': XING API: 403 Forbidden — The most likely cause of this error message is an invalid callback URL. \n::: ''errorXINGAPICall500'': XING API: 500 Read timeout: The most likely reason for this error message is that the XING server cannot be reached. \n:6. '''Application form''' (''/Vacancies/ID/Application/New''): Use [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] to enable the link to “Copy data from my XING profile” for display in the application form. (See the additional notes and forms in the following section.)\n\nYou can then test the interface by logging out of Umantis and XING and applying for a job on the job board you want to test. In the application form, click on the link to “Copy data from my XING profile”. If everything has been set up correctly, XING will now ask you to release your data for use.\n\n==Enabling the XING fields for display in the application form==\nOnce the interface has been set up, you can use [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] in your Applicant Management system to enable the function for display on the following pages:\n\n*'''External job board:'''\n:* in the appropriate forms (as previously)\n\n*'''Internal job board:'''\n:*''/Vacancies/ID/Application/New/ID'' (previously)\n:*''/Vacancies/ID/Application/New/ID/ID'' \n:*''/VacanciesIntraxData/ID/Application/New/ID''\n*'''Unsolicited applications:'''\n:*''/Vacancies/InitiativeApplication/ID''\n:*''/VacanciesIntraxData/InitiativeApplication/ID''\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The link to “'''Generate CV from my XING profile'''” can also be enabled for display in the application form. This link can be found below, and allows applicants to generate a CV/résumé from their XING profile.\n\n==Data copied over==\n\nThe following document lists all relevant résumé fields that are transferred from XING to Umantis: \n[[Media:XING_Template_DE_EN.zip|XING template (German & English)]]\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[IPM integration|IPM integration]]\n*[[CV Parsing|CV parsing]]\n*[[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]\n*[[Aconso - Digital personnel file|Aconso — Digital personnel files]]\n*[[Job board provider|Job board providers]]\n*[[Video interview - Interview suite by viasto|Video interview — Interview suite by viasto]]"

						"__text": "[[Category:Applicant management]]\n[[de:Terminplanungsassistent]]\nThe appointment scheduling wizard lets you check other people’s availability within your Umantis solution, both when creating one or more appointments for a job or when updating an existing appointment. You do not have to look for appropriate times in Outlook for each user individually, since the wizard checks the availability of other Applicant Management users in their Outlook calendars. \n\nIn this way, the appointment scheduling wizard can provide useful support in scheduling appointments.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Prerequisites and settings in Umantis==\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important notes:''' \n* The [[Information about the umantis interface#Activation in Applicant Management|new interface]] (internal) is a prerequisite for using the appointment scheduling wizard in your Umantis Applicant Management solution.\n* To access the Outlook calendars of the responsible individuals, the administrator must have login data that he can use to connect to the Mail Exchange Server. This is a prerequisite for access to Outlook calendars. The Mail Exchange Server should allow incoming external requests. In order not to completely enable Exchange, you can also just enable the Umantis-IP range for these calls:\n:* Data center Switzerland: 93.190.76.152/29\n:* Data Center Germany: 213.198.99.208/28\n* Your Umantis Applicant Management solution sends and receives requests and responses using the HTTPS protocol, which uses port 443 by default. Therefore, port 443 on the Mail Exchange Server should be open so that it can accept HTTPS requests for access to the Outlook calendars.\n* This function is currently only supported in Outlook 365 (via Exchange Server). The cloud version of Outlook 365 is not supported. \n* The \"Visibilities\" are based on Outlook. This means that the availability of a person cannot be checked if this person has completely blocked his/her Outlook calendar.\n\nUse this data and navigate to “''Interfaces > Third-party systems > Settings for appointment scheduling wizard''”. Then fill out the following fields under “Basic information about the interface”:\n* Exchange Server address \n: (''[[File:info.gif]] The following addition may be required as a URL extension of the Exchange Server Address: /EWS/Exchange.asmx'')\n* Username \n* Password\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that this data must be entered correctly in order for the “Check availabilities” button to appear.\n\n==Use==\nOnce setup is complete, you can use the appointment scheduling wizard to '''[[Appointments#Create appointment for a job|create new appointments for a job]]''' or [[Appointments#Actions in the detailed view of an appointment|update existing appointments]]. The following is a step-by-step example of how to schedule an appointment with the wizard:\n\n'''1.''' In the job view, navigate to the Appointments tab and click on “Add new appointment”. \n: The following screen appears: \n: [[File:Termin_Assistant_1_EN.png|650px|border]]\n:* Here you will find the responsible individuals listed for this job. The responsibilities for this job can be modified in the job description. \n:* '''Invite:''' Here you can modify the (pre-populated) email addresses of the responsible individuals, or enter additional ones.\n:* '''Optionally invite:''' Alternates are listed in this field, and new ones can be entered here.\n\n'''2.''' Click “Check availabilities”. \n: Enter the start date and end date or the time period for which you want to check availabilities. \n: The following screen appears: \n: [[File:Termin_Assistant_2_EN.png|650px|border]]\n: The selected individuals’ availabilities will now be displayed:\n:* Green: All participants are available\n:* Yellow: Not all participants are available \n:* Gray: No participants are available\n: To use one of the appointments, click on the appropriate (green or yellow) field and specify the length of the appointment in the dropdown menu. \n: [[File:info.gif]] The color scheme (green, yellow or gray) for the availability status is only displayed for those persons who are registered as [[User roles in Applicant Management|users]] in your applicant management solution. For people who are not registered as users in the system but belong to the same organization, calendars can also be checked using e-mail IDs, but color coding is not possible in this case. \n\n'''3.''' Once you have selected an appointment and specified its length, it will then appear under “Fixed appointments”:\n: [[File:Termin_Assistant_3_EN.png|450px|border]]\n\n'''4.''' In the bottom section, you can modify and send out an appointment invitation for the responsible individuals: \n: [[File:Termin_Assistant_4_EN.png|650px|border]]\n:* Send appointment invitation: Indicate here whether you want to send an appointment invitation to the people selected under “Invite” and “Optionally invite”.\n:* Subject: Enter an optional subject line for the appointment invitation. If you do not enter a value, the title of the appointment will be filled in as “Subject”. \n:* Message (HTML): Modify the message, then click “Save”.\n: [[File:attention.gif]] Please note that the appointment is not booked until after the invitation email has been sent out. \n: ‘”Confirm the settings you want to use for the appointment by clicking “Save”.’”\n: [[File:info.gif]] You can also use the appointment scheduling wizard when updating existing appointments (''/Recruiting/Courses/ID/ID/Basics/Edit'').\n\n==Errors and causes==\n=====“Check availabilities” button is not displayed=====\n* The “Check availabilities” button is only displayed if values have been entered in the settings for the interface. Note that the system does not check here whether the entered settings are actually correct. \n* The appointment scheduling wizard is only fully supported in connection with the [[Information about the umantis interface|new interface (2018)]]. \n\n=====Error message: “Service unavailable”=====\n* The interface is not set up correctly. Work with your IT manager to check the Mail Exchange Server settings and modify the interface settings in Umantis if necessary.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Appointments]]\n* [[Job description (applicant management)]]"

The DNS system of the Internet functions similarly to a telephone book: it manages the assignment between names and numbers. DNS servers translate name requests into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user reaches when entering a domain name into their web browser.\n\nThrough the SPF entry on the existing lists of your DNS server, you enable us to send emails with your domain name (firstname.lastname@kundendomain.de) from the applicant or staff management.

What happens to the data when we (don’t) hire this person? How is the information obligation pursuant to Art. 13 DSGVO implemented?\nYou will find more information at: https://www.pitchyou.de/pitchyou-dsgvo\n\n;Currently, data protection authorities prohibit the use of Facebook for the public domain. Facebook's data protection problems also correspond to WhatsApp as part of the group. What impact does this issue have on your product?\nYou will find more information at: https://www.pitchyou.de/pitchyou-dsgvo\n\n;Do WhatsApp or Facebook have access to the data via the chat?\nYou will find more information at: https://www.pitchyou.de/pitchyou-dsgvo\n\n;What are the monthly costs for PitchYou?\nPlease contact your dedicated contact person or via ht_crm@haufe.com.\n\n;Is there an interface to P&I Loga ? Concerns this Umantis and PitchYou ?\nOn the part of Umantis, interfaces to P&I Loga can be implemented.\n\n;We do not display the job ad in applicant management, but directly on the homepage via an API interface. Is integration with PitchYou possible in this case?\nYes.\n\n;Can you customize the chat to job ad and target group? \nYes.\n\n;Will the questions be adjusted in Umantis Applicant Management?\nNo, this is currently done through PitchYou's fast and reliable support.\n\n;Is it possible to change the questionnaires regularly?\nThe questionnaires can be customized at any time via PitchYou. \n\n;If someone accidentally clicks \"yes\" in the interview but actually wanted to click \"no\", can the applicant go back in the process?\nYes, you can jump back and also restart the interview at a certain point.\n\n;After receiving the application and saying \"We'll be in touch ...\" via WhatsApp - is it then possible for the applicant to contact us via WhatsApp as well?\nCurrently, an individual chat from Umantis Applicant Management is not (yet) available. A clear closing message such as \"...further communication will take place by mail / phone\" helps here. \n\n;(How) could you communicate further with the applicants themselves via WhatsApp?\nCurrently, this is only possible outside of Umantis via a separate PitchYou application.\n\n;If the job posting is advertised on StepStone, for example, and the applicant is then redirected to the applicant tool, can the applicant still select the WhatsApp application or does that have to be on the applicant's own website?\nYou will not find a WhatsApp button on Indeed and Stepstone at the moment. Unless the forms lead 1-to-1 to your job posting. More and more companies are also trying to drive more and more traffic to their own career site. Here, PitchYou delivers a corresponding conversion.\n\n;How does applicant communication continue after receipt of the application? Via WhatsApp or e-mail?\nFurther communication takes place directly from Umantis Mitarbeitermanagement - usually by e-mail.\n\n;How can I incorporate/integrate PitchYou into a paid campaign via social media?\nThis works wonderfully! Behind the button is a URL to jump into the interview.\n\n;Are the first and last name also in the contact details on the application?\nYes.\n\n;How does the written communication with the applicant work? Is it via e-mail or also via WhatsApp?\nSee question 12. Currently it is not possible to offer a 1to1 chat via WhatsApp from Umantis Applicant Management.\n\n;Which mobile number is behind the chat? \nYou set the stored number. It can be a mobile number, but also a landline number. We will support you here with the setup and selection as part of the onboarding process.\n\n;Is the same number always stored or can it also be varied depending on the staffing procedure?\nFor most customers one number is sufficient. But it is also possible to rotate, if you deposit several numbers / WaBa's.\n\n;There is a competitor that works with an avatar that reads the chat aloud. Is something like this planned?\nNo, we don't see any reason for that either. You have to type or dictate your answers there. Nothing else is done on WhatsApp. Only that it happens in the most popular channel in the world, we remind, translate, etc..\n\n;Can the questions also be supplemented with links to company films (e.g. shift work) or similar?\nYes.\n\n;If I want to start PitchYou as a pilot for one company, but the careers page is for all group divisions, is this feasible?\nYes.\n\n;How long does the technical setup take?\nApprox. 2-4 weeks. Ultimately, however, this also depends on how quickly the customer can \"deliver\" internally.\n\n;What happens to the voice messages of the applicants?\nVoice messages can thus be transmitted audio file (attachment).\n\n;Can I also contact the applicants from the system on WhatsApp? Interim notifications, requesting additional documents, etc.?\nCurrently not.\n\n;From an applicant's point of view, I'm giving my data, such as my resume or salary expectations, to WhatsApp and thus to Facebook, aren't I?\nYes, but the conversations are encrypted end-to-end. WhatsApp's data protection is primarily about the contacts in the phonebook, and these do NOT come into play with an API variant. See: https://www.pitchyou.de/pitchyou-dsgvo\n\n;The questions and answers of the questions are not shown under \"Questions\" in Umantis Applicant Management, are they? Only as a PDF summary?\nExactly, individual information such as name, date of birth, email, telephone number or address are automatically filled in the corresponding fields in Umantis Applicant Management. All other questions are submitted as a summary in a PDF.\n\n;Is it possible to include \"knockout questions\" where the interview is automatically terminated/the applicant gets a rejection? E.g. if the applicant does not live in the area and is therefore not an option.\nNo, this is not in the spirit of the Candidate Journey from our perspective. The interviews continue until the end.\n\n;Are there automatic rejections if a candidate is not qualified? \nNo, it is always the recruiter who decides.\n\n;Is the question block automated so that the interview can take place at any time?\nYes.\n\n;Can you link to \"all\" fields on the application file or is this a predefined set of fields that can be filled through the interface?\nThe fields are predefined. Currently, all contact information (name, date of birth, email, phone number or address) can be submitted.\n\n;Can the tool also be used for individual branch offices only? \nPlease get in touch with us. We have to check this in each individual case.\n\n;Is it possible to turn off the translation option? \nYes.\n\n;How many languages can be translated into? Do they have to be selected beforehand? \nCurrently, translation is possible into over 25 languages.\n\n;Are applications/interviews that have not been completed also transferred to Umantis Applicant Management so that candidates can be contacted again by phone, for example?\nYes, this is possible and can be set. \n\n;Is it possible to open the WhatsApp chat in the browser on the PC? \nYes.\n\n;How do I create the PitchYou templates?\nThe questionnaires themselves are created in PitchYou. In Umantis Applicant Management, a selection list can then be used to define which questionnaire is to be used for each position.\n\n;Are you considering expanding the cooperation to other messenger services?\nThat's a possibility, if necessary. Currently, we do not see any particular reason for this in the DACH region."

RSS is usually offered in the form of so-called RSS channels. The channel contains small elements of information (e.g. job title) that come from the original page. The provision of such data is known as an RSS feed. If the user has subscribed to the [http://www.wikipedia.org RSS-Channel], the client (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox etc.) will search the server for updates in the RSS feed. The recipient is informed regularly about any changes (similarly to a news ticker), and can use a feed reader to display those changes.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Note:'''<br> RSS does not work in newer versions of the Google Chrome browser (see also: http://googlereader.blogspot.de/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html).\n\n===When is an RSS feed used?===\nThanks to the standardization of RSS, this approach to publication can be applied easily across a wide range of contexts, but at the expense of design options. Many applications support RSS, thereby allowing for further processing of RSS content.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Typically, the RSS feed represents an alternative or additional approach to publication, alongside your company's own (external) job board.\n\n===What are the main attributes of the RSS Feed?===\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|'''Advantages'''\n|'''Disadvantages'''\n|-\n|\n* Because RSS content is provided in a standardized format, it is also suitable for further machine processing. (There are many applications which offer additional services for RSS content.)\n* The user can easily subscribe to an RSS feed.\n* Unlike job platforms or automatic exports, no explicit XSLT is required for the data mapping.\n|\n* Only minimal customizations, if any, can be made to the design.\n* The structure is defined by the RSS standard.\n* By default, only full-text search is supported.\n* A separate RSS feed must be defined for each language.\n* Unlike your company's own job board or other job platforms, publication through an RSS feed cannot be defined at the level of an individual job.\n|-\n|}\n\n==Creating a new RSS feed==\n[[File:info.gif]] Note: the MASK SQL flag is enabled by default when creating a new RSS feed. Disable the MASK SQL flag if special characters are used when creating the RSS feed. \n\nThe RSS feed data are extracted using an SQL script. and then structured implicitly (without a dedicated XSLT file) in accordance with the RSS standard (XML format). Only certain marginal aspects of the formatting/design, e.g. logos, can influenced. The RSS feed can then be accessed through a dedicated URL, or integrated in the company's own website.<br>\nA separate RSS feed must be defined for each publication language.\n<br><br>\n\nCreate a new RSS feed with the action \"'''+  Create new RSS feed'''\":<br>\n\n;Elements shown in the feed\n* '''Channel''' \n: The title of the RSS feed (e.g. \"Advertised jobs\").\n* '''Base URL''' \n: Corresponds to the address of your home page (e.g. www.umantis.com). \n* '''RSS feed description'''\n: Provide a brief, meaningful description of the feed.\n* '''Publisher'''\n* '''Logo'''\n: You have the option to upload a logo here. \n* '''Logo title'''\n: Enter a logo title.\n* '''Logo link'''\n: Enter a logo link. \n\n;Technical details - SQL for the channel elements shown in the feed\n* '''SQL query''' \n: A database query used to extract the relevant job data. '''Note:''' The mapping to the RSS standard XML is performed via aliases in the SQL script. Typically, the jobs that are selected are those that are currently published on the company's own (external) job board. <br>[[File:info.gif]] The following elements are important for the presentation of channel items: \n::* title\n::* description\n::* link \n::* guid\n::* pubDate \nThe mapping to XML is performed via aliases in the SQL script. The [hostname] variable is automatically replaced with the first part of the customer URL (<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-XY.umantis.com/</nowiki>). It is recommended that you place any additional information for channel items (e.g. Location) in the \"description\" field. Additional specific elements (which must be assigned to a namespace) can also be defined in the form. \n:[[File:info.gif]] More elements (up to 5) can be added - see the section on \"Configuring namespaces for additional fields in an RSS feed\". \n* '''Escape SQL data'''\n: Place a checkmark here to replace special characters in the SQL query result.\n* '''Comment'''\n: Enter a comment about the RSS feed.\n* '''Language'''\n: Indicate the language.\n\n; Configuring namespaces for additional fields in an RSS feed\nBesides the \"default\" elements ''title, description, link, guid'' and ''pubDate'', additional fields (up to 5) can be defined for a specific presentation of channel items. For each element, enter the same field name as in the SQL query, along with a namespace and a namespace URL. \n* '''Name field 1'''\n: Enter the field name (in accordance with the SQL).\n* '''Namespace field 1'''\n: Enter the namespace. \n* '''Namespace URL 1'''\n: Enter the URL for the namespace.\n\n\nClick on \"Save and verify SQL\" to save the RSS feed (and verify the SQL). The update interval (in minutes) can then be defined in edit mode. \n\n[[File:info.gif]]'''Note:''' Once an RSS feed has been created, it must still be activated before it can be used. You can do this with the '''Start updating RSS feeds''' action.\n<br><br>\n\n===Accessing an RSS feed===\nYou can access the RSS feed by entering a parameterized URL:<br>\n''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/RssFeed/[RSSFeedID]/rss.xml</nowiki>''\n<br>\n* '''[CustomerID]''': The ID for the customer solution (e.g. 1067)\n* '''[RSSFeedID]''': The ID for the RSS feed (e.g. 70)\n<br>\n''Example:''<br>\n''<nowiki>https://recruitingapp-1067.umantis.com/RssFeed/70/rss.xml </nowiki>''\n<br><br>\n\n===Activating or deactivating RSS feeds===\nAfter an RSS feed has been created, it can be activated with the action \"''Start updating RSS feeds''\". Similarly, an RSS feed can be deactivated with the action \"''Stop updating RSS feeds''\". <br>[[File:info.gif]] Depending on the current \"status\" of the RSS feeds, the appropriate link is shown in the Actions.\n\n==Integrating an RSS feed in the website==\nThe code shown below can be used to insert an RSS feed into the website.<br>\n\nA link to the RSS feed should be included in your website header.\n\n''<nowiki><head></nowiki>''<br>\n''  <nowiki><link href=\"https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/RssFeed/[RSSFeedID]/rss.xml\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"our job offers\" /></nowiki>''<br>\n''  <nowiki><link href=\"...change...\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/atom+xml\" title=\"...change...\" /></nowiki>''<br>\n''<nowiki></head>''</nowiki>''<br>\n\n<br>\nYou can also integrate the individual RSS feeds into your website as direct links.<br>\n\n''<nowiki><body></nowiki>''<br>\n''  <nowiki><a href=\"https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/RssFeed/[RSSFeedID]/rss.xml\">rss feed</a></nowiki>''<br>\n''  <nowiki><a href=\"https://recruitingapp-[CustomerID].umantis.com/RssFeed/[RSSFeedID]/rss.xml\"><img src=\"http://www.yourdomain.com/image.png\"></a></nowiki>''<br>\n''<nowiki></body></nowiki>''\n\n\n==Related subjects==\n* [[Vacancy notice|Publishing jobs]]\n* [[External vacancy notice|External job posting]]\n* [[Internal publication (applicant management)|Internal job posting]]\n* [[Job platforms]]\n* [[Job platform providers]]\n* [[Automatic exports]]"

In addition, there is also the option of displaying your overall assessment in the form of stars in the timeline. \n\n[[File:movie.gif]] '''>> Click here for the explanatory video on how to map the overall rating in the form of stars:''' [https://youtu.be/On4l9wY6RHg Video tutorial on star configuration]\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''IMPORTANT!'''<br>\nWhen you resubmit an assessment, the original assessment will be overwritten with the new one as well as the associated comment.\n\nWithout star configuration:\n\n[[File:05-EN-Gesamtbeurteilung-ABC.png|500px|border]]\n\nWith star configuration:\n\n[[File:06-EN-Gesamtbeurteilung-Sterne.png|500px|border]]\n\n====Comment/remark on status assignment (HR)/proposal next step (Manager) and/or overall assessment.====\nIn the HR cockpit as well as in the manager cockpit, you have the option to combine the status assignment (HR)/proposal next step (manager) and/or the overall assessment with a comment/remark.\n\nHere, for example, you should explain in more detail why you gave the application a certain rating.\n\n===== [[File:attention.gif]] '''IMPORTANT!''' =====\nUse the comment/remark function only in combination with a status assignment (HR)/suggestion next step (manager) and an overall assessment. \nIf you want to enter other communications and have them visible in the timeline (e.g. notes on the interview), you can find more information at: [[#Create communication note|Create communication note]].\n\n[[File:07-EN-Kommentar-Bemerkung.png|500px|border]]\n\n====Filter selection====\nTo give you an even more structured overview, you now also have a selection of different filters within the timeline. So you can select for yourself which aspects you want to look at more closely. You have the following options:\n* All\n* Communication\n* Evaluation\n* Status\n* Internal notes\n\nIt should be noted that \"Communication\" and \"Internal note\" distinguish between different types of communications.<br>\nAt \"Communication\" you can see all recorded communications with the applicant like e-mail communications. <br>\nAt \"Internal notes\" communication notes are displayed of the type:\n* Call incoming\n* Call outgoing\n* Information\n* Note\n\n[[File:08-EN-Filter_neu.png|500px|border]]\n\n====Other important information====\nFurthermore, there are also two redundant functions that have not been adopted in the timeline itself. These include the communication note and forwarding to other persons. You can still create the communication note in the action menu under \"Communication\" (''/Recruiting/Applications/[Application.ID]/[Applicant.ID]/Contacts'').\n\n====Create communication note==== \nIn the HR Cockpit, you can create a new \"Communication note\" under \"Communication\" (may need to be displayed). There you can record, among other things, notes about a call or your impression of the application. All your communication notes are displayed in the timeline and are displayed under different filtering depending on the type.\n\nWithout \"top focus action\" button:\n\n[[File:09-EN-HR-Kommunikationsnotiz.png|500px|border]]\n\nWith \"top focus action\" button:  \n\n[[File:10-EN-Topfocus.png|500px|border]]\n\nFor the manager cockpit, this function is generally available, but hidden. If you want the managers to have the possibility to enter communication notes as well, you have to show this function in the manager cockpit (''/SelfServiceLine'') via the \"Customize view\" mode (Logged in as administrator):\n\n[[File:11-EN-VGKommunikationsnotiz.png|500px|border]]\n\nSubsequently, you can still specify that \"Create communication note\" can be easily captured via a \"top focus action\" button. To do this, go next to the yellow highlighted text in the screenshot above on the gear wheel:\n\n[[File:12-EN-VGTopfocus.png|500px|border]]\n\nThe button will then appear in the top right corner of the dossier under \"Actions\":\n\n[[File:13-EN-FinalTFA.png|500px|border]]\n\n====Forward to other persons==== \nForwarding to other persons is also possible as usual under the following tabs:\n* Documents (''/Recruiting/Applications/[Bewerbung.ID]/[Bewerber.ID]/Details''),\n* HR assessment (''/Recruiting/Applications/[Bewerbung.ID]/[Bewerber.ID]/Preselection'')\n* Assessments (''/Recruiting/Applications/[Bewerbung.ID]/[Bewerber.ID]/Appraisals'')\n\n[[File:14-EN-Weiterleitung.png|500px|border]]"

Specifically, the program has access to over 10 years of data, which is used to evaluate the performance and conversion rate of the ad and platform based on location, job title, and job description. Additionally, the program continuously learns and optimizes itself.\n\n===What can PandoLogic's Programmatic BOOST do?===\nWith this combined knowledge, the program determines the best channel for publishing your job advertisement. The ads are published where they generate the most attention and achieve the best results, including major platforms such as Talent.com, Indeed, and Monster, as well as niche job boards and other job platforms. This is unique worldwide, and the results speak for themselves - learn more here (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/08/16/2498898/0/en/New-Research-from-PandoLogic-Finds-Pay-Scale-Transparency-and-Remote-Work-Options-Lower-Cost-of-Hiring-by-as-Much-as-5X.html).\n\n===How does PandoLogic's Programmatic BOOST work?===\nTo find the best channels and platforms, the program pulls three key points from the job advertisement: job title, job description, and location. Based on this information, the artificial intelligence searches the existing database of information and platforms and selects the best options for placing your job advertisement. This may mean that the job advertisement is not only published on one platform and may change over time based on the algorithm's constant learning. Specifically, today your job advertisement may be published on Channel X, and tomorrow on Channel Y.\n\n===What are the benefits for you as a customer?===\nMany! The underlying artificial intelligence aims to ensure that your ad appears on relevant channels, increasing both the number and quality of applicants while reducing advertising costs. The performance is transparent to you, and you can see the results of your publication in terms of clicks and applications in your solution.\n\n===What do you need to consider in this regard?===\nSince it is a highly efficient form of recruiting, it is more complex than other methods. For example, you cannot see at what time the ad will be published on which platform. Therefore, you cannot track the job posting.\nYou also cannot influence which platform your job posting will end up on. The program is not a guarantee that the ad will appear on your preferred site, as the algorithm is based on numbers and data. Through continuous learning, the job posting may also be displayed on other platforms during the runtime.\n\n===What are the different options I have with PandoLogic?===\nPandoLogic offers three different programs in our multiposting feature:\n# Programmatic Boost Light, Powered by Pandologic - € 150 - 10 Day Duration <br>The short program with full functionality and for 10 days.\n#Programmatic Boost, Powered by Pandologic - € 400 - 30 Day Duration <br>The long program with full functionality and for 30 days.\n# Programmatic Boost, Extra Powered by Pandologic - € 800 - 30 Day Duration <br>The long program with full functionality, for 30 days, and in \"pole position\" or as a \"sponsored\" ad on the respective job platform.\n\n===Where can I find more information about my questions?===\nIf you would like more information, you can also take a look at the PandoLogic website (https://pandologic.com/recruiting-with-ai/).\n\n==Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)==\n\n===Where can I find the Multiposting feature in my solution?===\nThe Multiposting feature is included in your Haufe Applicant Management solution. You can access it for a job opening by clicking on the \"External job postings\" tab and selecting \"Multiposting\".\n\n===Do I have to pay a fee to activate the Multiposting feature?===\nNo, activation of the Multiposting feature is free of charge. The only costs incurred are those of the job platforms when positions are published on them. These costs will be displayed transparently to you.\n\n===Which user roles have access to the Multiposting feature?===\nAdministrators and HR administrators/assistants who also have permission to advertise a job opening have access to the Multiposting feature.\n\n===Can access to the Multiposting feature be restricted to specific HR administrators/assistants and/or branches?===\nRestricting access to specific branches is not possible. Access can be restricted to specific HR administrators/assistants by granting/revoking permission to advertise a job opening, which can be done as described above. Alternatively, it is possible to assign the \"Sensitive Data\" permission to the Multiposting feature and then allocate this permission only to selected users and user roles.\n\n===What job posting contents can currently be displayed using the Multiposting feature?===\nJob posting contents that have been entered as text blocks (title, text blocks, contact) can currently be displayed using the Multiposting feature. Selection lists or contents that are fixed in the advertisement layout can be inserted into unused text fields and thus incorporated into the job posting.\n\n===How can I still include job posting contents that are stored as a selection list or are fixed in the advertisement layout in the Multiposting feature?===\nA total of 8 text block titles, as well as 8 corresponding text blocks and one contact field per position are available. If one of these fields is still available, contents that are currently fixed in the advertisement layout can be entered into a free title or text block for the Multiposting feature.\n\n===Where can the job posting contents for the Multiposting feature be adjusted?===\nThe contents can be adjusted in the job posting contents of the corresponding position (text block or text block title) before publication. Adjusting the order of the contents (e.g. \"We offer\" before \"You bring with you\") is done by adjusting the CWC mode. Adjusting the contents within the Multiposting feature itself or making adjustments after publication is currently not possible.\n\n===Where can the order or arrangement of job posting contents (text block titles, text blocks) be adjusted in the Multiposting feature?===\nThe order or arrangement of the contents can be adjusted in the job posting contents. As an account administrator, simply go to \"Settings\" (top right) and enter \"Customize view\" mode, then drag and drop the text block titles or text blocks.\n\n===What filter options are available for the platforms?===\nThere are various filters on the left-hand side of the Multiposting feature. You can filter by job function, job title, and location. Job titles and locations work on the principle of a Google search. Suggestions are made after entering a few letters. For the location filter, you can filter by a location (e.g. Geneva) or by a country (e.g. Switzerland).\n\n===On what basis are the platform recommendations generated?===\nThe recommendations are based on the information provided for the position (location, job title, and function). It is then examined which functions, positions, and locations are preferred on which job platform. The recommendations are then generated accordingly.\n\n===Why do certain platforms specify a setup time in addition to the upload time?===\nCertain platforms require an additional setup time when using the multiposting feature for the first time. After that, only the upload time has to be taken into account for each additional job that is published via this platform. The selected posting time of the job is not affected by this.\n\n===Why are certain multiposting platforms subject to a fee when a job is published, even though they would be free of charge if used individually?===\nBehind the entire multiposting function is a lot of administrative effort for the integration and for the maintenance of the platform within our applicant management solution. The small costs incurred for this therefore cover the costs incurred on our side. However, on your side, the additional effort of creating each new platform is also eliminated, saving you time as well.\n\n===Why do details in the job posting and job criteria need to include additional information such as industry, job function, weekly working hours, or education level?===\nThe details in the job posting must be recorded, as these are a basic requirement for certain platforms. The information to be entered is the most common values that are required by the platforms offered. With the help of this data, the platforms can ensure a refinement of the search.\n\n===Where does the information about the work location, which is stored in the job criteria, come from?===\nThe information on the work location is the address of the branch that is stored for the selected job. The stored values can be overwritten manually for the respective branch. If no values are stored in advance, the values are also missing for the corresponding branch and can be stored there centrally.\n\n===Where can I see the current status of a post published via the multiposting function?===\nWithin the multiposting function, the \"Published\" tab is located at the top right. There you can see the status of the publication per post and platform. A distinction is made between the following statuses:\n* Being uploaded: The post is currently being submitted to the selected platform. The upload time depends on the selected platform and will be shown to you before the purchase.\n* Published: The job has been published to the selected platform and can be viewed there.\n* Not processed: The job could not be published on the selected platform. Please try again.\n* Offline: The selected platform either no longer exists or the publication was canceled. There are no costs for you in this case. A job posting that has already expired is also displayed with this status and has already been charged.\n\n===How can I find a job published via multiposting on a platform?===\nTo do this, please go to the \"Published\" tab (top right) in the multiposting function. There you can access the published post directly via a link for each post and selected platform. However, not every platform offers this option. Alternatively, the platform can be called up separately and the published job can be searched for directly once it has been published via multiposting.\n\n===Can the duration of a job published with the multiposting function be extended?===\nThis is not possible, but the job can be published again with the multiposting function.\n\n===Can I check myself how many jobs have been published using the multiposting function?===\nYes, within the multiposting function under the tab \"Published\" (top right) the published campaigns incl. their costs, as well as clients can be tracked. In addition, administrators can generate a report on the jobs that were published within a defined period of time using the multiposting function under /integrations-vonq/positions/campaigns/invoice/csv?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYYY-MM-DD. The parameters \"startDate\" and \"endDate\" have to be added to the URL accordingly. If you have any further questions that are not currently listed, please let us know. We would also appreciate your feedback regarding the function and any further development requests you may have. You can also get more information in our short [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4IXOAzoB8M video tutorial] and our detailed [https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/recording/3586501805373740640 web seminar].\n\n===What about further partnerships in multiposting?===\nWe are constantly working on this. We will not inform you about every new partnership, but we will be happy to send you the highlights.\n\n===Will there be an interface to the \"Bundesagentur für Arbeit\" (Federal Employment Agency)?===\nYes, such an interface will be made available as part of our multiposting. The \"HR BA XML interface\" to the \"Bundesagentur für Arbeit\" (Federal Employment Agency) is currently in the development phase. We will inform you as soon as this is productively available."

They notify the HR expert of their needs by means of a staffing request. As part of the approval process, they might be asked whether the proposed job description can be published. When the job applications have been received, the HR experts send the various applicant profiles and their documents to the hiring managers for evaluation. The hiring managers then enter their evaluation of each application (in structured and free-text formats), and indicate what step they want to take next (e.g. invite to interview, reject, wait, ...).

In most cases, the evaluation variants (selection value or numeric value) cannot/should not be changed if one wishes to benefit from the convenience of a proposed calculation. It is only at the very end, with the proposed calculation for level 4, that one has the option of using [[Calculation formulae|calculation formulae]]  to cross over to the other evaluation track (selection value on proposal in % or vice versa).\n\n'''From level 1 to level 2:'''<br /> The average of all [[third party evaluations|third party evaluations]]  for each e.g. individual objective is constructed unweighted and offered as a proposal at the next level.

This means that it is only when one has entered an evaluation that this value is used in calculations. Prior to this it is not used in the calculation. This means that, right at the beginning of your evaluation phase (after maybe just 2 out of 5 objectives have been evaluated), you can already see an overall proposal which already approximates the final proposal (if the evaluation quality is maintained) or can, at least, serve as a prediction. \n\n<br /> If one does not want particular sub-areas to feed into the overall evaluation, these can be weighted with 0.

In which languages do you want to provide this survey? (You can currently select up to 4 languages.) Will it be possible to associate the individual survey answers to the survey participants or not? \n\n==Settings==\n*Number, label and status: These values are only used as identifiers. They do not control any functions.\n*Languages: Control the possible inputs for the questions and answers, and the resulting possibilities for those giving the answers. Before taking the survey, each survey participant is asked in which language they wish to answer the poll, provided that more than one language has been activated.\n*Anonymous surveys: Lose the option of associating the answers to the participants. Of course, anonymity is undermined if there is just one participant and one answer set, so please watch out for this situation. It is NOT possible to retroactively de-anonymize answers that have already been given.\n* Extended anonymity: This option only has an effect if you have marked this as an Anonymous survey. Choosing this option prevents the manager's name from being saved in the contextual information for the answers, and a parent organizational unit is saved (if one is present). \n*Public surveys:  are published under /Public/PollParticipations and can also be answered by people outside the system (self-registered external persons). All other surveys are published ONLY to the employee view when they are started.\n*Survey series, type, category, start and end are also ONLY descriptive in nature, and are used to help you, the poll administrator, keep track of your surveys.\n*Access via organizational unit: Here, you can restrict the administration of surveys, so that surveys do not have unintended influence on each other. Whether a survey is displayed in the employee view depends on whether the employee has been added as a participant. In this way, you can control who is permitted to view this survey. \n*Target group, subject, goal and user-defined are, again, ONLY descriptive.\n*Visible to managers: This means that the answers may also be viewed by employees who are allowed to use the manager view, but who have NOT activated the Surveys module. The aim here is to give managers the option of reading manager feedback which affects precisely the managers concerned. So a manager can see surveys which have been answered by at least one of his or her direct subordinates - and ONLY those particular answers. A survey of this type is also useful for multiple managers who are not permitted to see one another's answers. This type of survey MUST be answered in the employee view (not Public), because the job information is important.\n\n==Enter a publication title and brief description for the survey==\n\nIn the &quot;Survey profile&quot; tab, you can use the &quot;Survey description&quot; area to enter a publication title and a brief description for the publication lists /SelfService/MyPollParticipations and /Public/PollParticipations in the languages that are activated in the Settings.\n\n==Create questions and answers==\n\nIn the &quot;Survey profile&quot; tab, you can use the &quot;Questions&quot; area to define as many questions as you like, with up to 15 pre-defined answers for each question. As before, you can only enter languages which have previously been activated in the settings. You can specify the answer type for each question. \nThe options are: \n#Free text:  These are free-form answers which CANNOT be evaluated in a structured way. \n#Pre-defined, single answer, with text:  In this case, participants can select just one of the pre-defined answers in a structured way using radio buttons, and also enter a piece of free text. \n#Pre-defined, multiple answer, with text:   With this option, participants can select one or more of the pre-defined answers in a structured way (using checkboxes this time), and also enter a piece of free text.\n\n*'''Position your questions''' (sequential order) by entering the value &quot;Position&quot;. \n*'''Color of the answer in the default diagram''': To format [[Survey analyses|analytics]] much more intuitively as a [[Diagrams / Dashboards / Charts|diagram]], you can select your own preferred color for the answer (hexadecimal with no #, e.g. &quot;FF33DD&quot;). If you do not enter a value, then an answer-neutral, easily distinguishable default color will be used. [[Survey analyses#Overview of poll result|See also]]\n\n==Assigning surveys to participants==\nThere are various ways of bringing surveys to the attention of your potential respondents.\n# '''Publish publicly:''' When the survey is started, it can immediately be viewed and answered by everyone under /Public/PollParticipations.\n# '''Assign to specific employees:''' Depending on your access permissions, this option allows you to directly assign the relevant employees to the survey in the participants overview, and to send them an email through the participants list with a link to the survey. You can also activate this process from the employees overview. The multiple action for doing this is called &quot;Add to existing survey&quot;. Assigned employees see the surveys in the employee view under: /SelfService/MyPollParticipations\n# '''Assign to all employees:''' It is possible to register oneself for a survey. The process is somewhat technical: There is a URL which includes the IDs of the relevant survey and the potential participant, and which can be sent to each employee. Of course, you can also assign ALL the employees to a survey in advance. \n\n'''Technical description for 3:'''\nThe URL is /SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/ID/SelfConnectPosition/ID. This URL does NOT work for external individuals, but only for people who have an active employee job in the system. (See point 1) There are two IDs/variables in this URL: The survey ID is fixed. The job ID will of course be highly variable. The ...Poll/ID part must be replaced by the relevant ID (e.g.: ...Poll/104), and the ...SelfConnectPosition/ID part must be replaced by the job ID (e.g.: ...SelfConnectPosition/[Stelle.ID] or SelfConnectPosition/[SwitchPositionID]). Now you can choose whether to use the link in an email or in the wizard. If you use the variable [Stelle.ID], it becomes a variable in an email, sent via the employees overview. Use [SwitchPositionID] to make it a variable in a wizard, or when the link is directly integrated on the home page in the employee view.\n\nWhen you're done, the whole thing will look like this:\n\nUsed in an email -&gt; /SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/104/SelfConnectPosition/[Stelle.ID],\n \nUsed in a wizard or integrated into the home page as a link in the solution-/SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/104/SelfConnectPosition/[SwitchPositionID]\n\nThis process can be simplified by creating an email template in which you only need to change the survey ID. The rest remains the same. The same applies to integrating a link into the wizard. Only the ID of the survey itself is variable.\n\n==Ease of use when inviting a participant==\n\nUsing the &quot;Default email template for this survey&quot;, you can create a dedicated communication template which might include e.g. a link to a specialized wizard to guide users gently through the answering process. The link to a wizard that guides users specifically through YOUR NEW survey and has been integrated into the template might look something like this: &quot;https://employeeapp-[YourNumber].umantis.com/Wizard/162/104&quot;.  For more on this, see the next section.\n\n==Ease of use when answering a survey==\nWhen a participant is answering our surveys, they can also be automatically guided through the questions. To do this, a wizard has to be created which leads them directly to the survey questions. The wizard must have exactly the same number of steps as the survey has questions. Your solution includes a sample wizard: /Administration/Wizards/162/Profile -&gt; &quot;SelfService_To employee satisfaction survey&quot;. Take this wizard 162 as your copy template and create the wizard for your own survey, which ONLY needs to differ in the number and ID of steps 2 to n. You can get the IDs of the steps by hovering your mouse over the pencil icon for each question when you are editing the questions. Invoke your wizard using the wizard ID and the survey ID together: Wizard/[YourWizardID]/[YourSurveyID]. In our example the assistant is invoked via e.g. /Wizard/162/104 if you want to answer survey 104.\n\n==Related subjects==\n* [[Surveys]]\n* [[Create new survey]]\n* [[Survey analyses]]"

Click on “Create new behavioral criterion” to enter a new behavioral criterion for the selected employee.\n\nGive the criterion a title (*required field) and select the appropriate category. Optionally, you can also enter a date. Next, fill in the description. You can also set up a reminder email to be sent to the employee (check the box). If you do not want this behavioral criterion to be visible to the employee, please check the box for “Not visible to employee”. \n\nIf you want to create additional criteria, check the box for “Create additional behavioral criterion”, then click “Save”. The criterion is then saved and a new, empty window appears. You can enter another criterion by following the same procedure as above.\n\nIf criteria remain the same, you can choose to copy criteria from other employees or from previous years by clicking on \"Copy behavioral criterion from other employees or earlier periods”.\n\nOnce you have finished creating the criterion and are ready to lock in the criteria, go to the Actions section and select “Agree”.\n\n==Assess behavioral criteria==\n\nThe “Assess behavioral criteria” link will take you to the view in which you can assess individual criteria on a scale. <br>\nSee also: [[Average calculations from employee evaluations|Average calculations from employee assessments]] and [[Overall evaluation|Overall assessment]].\n\n==Examples of behavioral criteria==\n\n* '''Account Manager'''\n** presentation technique\n** independence/Initiative\n** communication skills\n** network thinking\n** Willingness to change\n\n* '''Sprinter'''\n** works well under pressure\n** set own priorities\n** reliability\n** Motivation/Ability to perform\n\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]\n* [[Overall evaluation|Overall assessment]]\n* [[Objectives|Goals]]\n* [[Job tasks | Tasks]]\n* [[Competencies|Competencies]]\n* [[Development objectives|Development goals]]\n* [[Feedback topics|Feedback topics]]"

A poll participant is asked prior to answering which language they wish to use to answer the poll, providing more than 1 language has been activated.\n*  Anonymous polls: lose the option of assigning the answers to the participants. Of course, just 1 participant and 1 answer set would undermine this function... so please watch out for this condition. Retrospectively de-anonymising answers that have already been given is NOT possible.\n*  Public polls:  are published under /Public/PollParticipations and can also be answered by people outside the system (self-registering external people). All other polls ONLY get into the employees area when they are started.\n*  Poll series, type, category, start and end are, again, ONLY descriptive and are used to give you, the poll administrator, an overview.\n*  Access via organisation unit: Here I can restrict the administration of polls so that one is not mutually and unpleasantly influenced. Whether or not a poll is displayed in the employee area depends on whether the employee has been added as a participant. In this way I can control who is permitted to view this poll. \n*  Target group, subject, objective and user-defined are, again, ONLY descriptive.\n*  Visible to superiors: means that the answers may also be viewed by employees who are allowed in the superiors area but have NOT activated the Polls module. The aim here is to give the superiors the option of reading the superiors feedback which purely affects the superior concerned. So I can see polls which have been answered by at least one of my direct subordinates. And ONLY those particular answers. So with this type of poll I can also help multiple superiors who are not permitted to see one another's answers. This type of poll MUST be answered in the employee (not public) area, because the job information is important.\n\n==Enter a publishing title and short description for the poll==\n\nIn the \"Poll profile\" tab, in the \"Poll description\" area, I can enter a publishing title and a short description for the publishing lists /SelfService/MyPollParticipations and /Public/PollParticipations in the languages that are activated under settings.\n\n<br />\n\n==Create questions and answers==\n\nIn the \"Poll profile\" tab, in the \"Questions\" area, I can define as many questions as I want, with up to 15 pre-defined answers for each question. Here, too, I can only enter languages which I have previously activated in the settings. I can prescribe the answer type for each question. Options are: \n\n#  Free text: These are freely definable answers which can NOT be evaluated in a structured way. \n#  Prescribed, simple, with text:  Here I can both select just one of the prescribed answers in a structured way using radio buttons, and also enter a piece of free text. \n#  Prescribed, multiple, with text:   Here, again, I can both select all of the prescribed answers in a structured way using (this time) checkboxes, and also enter a piece of free text.\n\n*  '''Position your questions''' (sequence) by entering the value \"Position\". \n*  '''Colour of the answer in the default diagram''': So that you can far more intuitively design the [[Survey Analyses|evaluations]] as a diagram, you can select the colour to be used for the answer yourself (hexadecimal with no # E.g. \"FF33DD\"). If you do not make use of this, we shall use an answer-neutral, easily distinguishable, default colour. [[Survey Analyses#Overview of poll result|See also]]\n\n==How can I assign polls to participants==\n\nThere are different ways of bringing polls to the attention of your potential respondents.\n\n#  '''Publish publicly:''' Then the poll, when it is started, can immediately be viewed and answered by everyone under /Public/PollParticipations.\n#  '''Assign to specific employees:''' Here, based on my access permissions, I can directly assign the employees concerned to the poll in the participants overview, and I can send them an email with a link to the poll via the participants list. I can also activate this process from the employees overview. The name of the multiple action for doing this is: \"Add to existing poll\". Assigned employees see the polls in the employees area under: /SelfService/MyPollParticipations\n#  '''Assign to all employees:''' There is the option to register oneself for a poll. Now it becomes a little bit technical: For this there is a URL which includes the ID of the relevant poll and the potential participant and which can be sent to each employee. I can, of course, assign ALL the employees to a poll up-front. \n\n\n'''Technical description for 3:''' The URL is /SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/ID/SelfConnectPosition/ID. This URL does NOT work for external people, but only for people who have an active employee job in the system. (See point 1) There are 2 IDs/variables in this URL: The poll ID is fixed... the job ID, of course, has to be variable. The ...Poll/ID part must be replaced by the relevant ID (E.g.: ...Poll/104) and the ...SelfConnectPosition/ID part must be replaced by the job ID (E.g.: ...SelfConnectPosition/[Stellen.ID] or SelfConnectPosition/[SwitchPositionID] ). Now I can choose whether I use the link in an email or in the assistant. It becomes a variable in an email, sent via the employees overview, by using the variable [Stellen.ID] It becomes a variable in an assistant or by integrating the link directly into the homepage in the employees area by using [SwitchPositionID].  <br /> Finally the whole thing looks like this:  <br /> Used in an email -&gt; /SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/104/SelfConnectPosition/[Stellen.ID],  <br /> Used in an assistant or integrated into homepage as a link in the solution-&gt; /SelfService/MyPollParticipations/Poll/104/SelfConnectPosition/[SwitchPositionID] <br /> This process can be simplified by creating an email template in which one only needs to change the poll ID.... the rest remains the same. The same applies to integrating a link into the assistant. Only the ID of the poll itself is variable.\n\n==Ease of use when inviting a participant==\n\nUsing the \"Default email template for this poll\", one can create a dedicated communication template which, e.g., includes a link to a specific assistant which guides users gently through the answering process. The link to an assistant which guides users specifically through YOUR NEW poll and has been integrated into the template might look like this: \"https&nbsp;://employeeapp-[IhreNummer].umantis.com/Wizard/162/104\".  For more on this, read the next section.\n\n==Ease of use when answering a poll==\n\nWhen a participant is answering our polls, they can also be automatically guided through the questions. To do this, an assistant has to be created which leads them specifically to the relevant questions. The assistant has to have precisely the same number of steps as the poll has questions. You have a sample assistant in your solution: /Administration/Wizards/162/Profile -&gt; \"SelfService_Employee Satisfaction Poll\". Take this assistant 162 as your copy template and create your assistant for the poll concerned which ONLY needs to differentiate between the number and the ID of step 2 to n. You can get the IDs of the steps by hovering you mouse over the pencil icon for each question when you are editing the questions. Invoke your assistant using the assistant ID and the poll ID together: /Wizard/[IhreAssistentenID]/[IhreUmfrageID]. In our example the assistant is invoked via e.g. /Wizard/162/104 if you wish to answer poll 104.\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  [[Surveys|Surveys]]\n*  [[Create New Survey|Create New Survey]]\n*  [[Survey Analyses|Survey Analyses]]"

For example, when you hire a new team member, you provide personal data that will be imported. However, the individual pieces of information about the position do not need to be imported separately if the position already exists. In this case, simply specify the position and the position data that you want to be assigned to the new team member with the import. To do this, use the field for position staffing (“Position group ID”) in the view of a position. This field groups together all positions with the same value for succession planning, and lists all employees with the same ID in the “Staffing” tab. <br>\nThe following variables are available here: \n* Stelle.KopiereVonQuellsystemSchluessel\n* Stelle.KopiereVonStellenSchluessel\n* Stelle.KopiereVonPersonenSchluessel \n\nYou can use the following variables to specify what should be copied from the position: \n* Stelle.KopiereAllgemeineDaten\n* Stelle.KopiereDokumenteZurStelle\n* Stelle.KopiereUebergebeObjekte\n* Stelle.KopiereAktuelleLohndaten\n* Stelle.KopiereNotizen\n\n[[File:info.gif]] “Job ID is unique” has been renamed to “Import job ID is group ID”.\n\n==Field list Employee-Jobs Import==\n[[File:info.gif]] Use the information in the following overview table to supplement your [[Imports in Employee Management|Import templates]].

A continuing education program is therefore a kind of \"grouping\" of several events. For events that are associated with the same development program, attending each individual event is mandatory in order for the main event to be regarded as settled. Main events and sub-events can also exist without an associated development program (see also [[Development program#Graphical visualization|graphics below]]).\n\n==Create a new development program==\n\nThe following procedure is recommended for setting up a development program:\n\n*  Define the name of the training program in [[Selection lists|Selection lists]] (List 88) under the events section.\n*  Create an event (if it does not already exist)\n*  Assignment an event to a continuing education program\n*  Creating further main events / sub-events within an event, which are assigned to a development program.\n*  Assigning employees to the development program via [[Settings in employee file|Employee file]] or directly via the tab \"Participants\" in the event\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]]  If someone attends the sub-event of a main event which is assigned to a development program (only the main event itself), then the other events of this main event are regarded as being settled!\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]] Main events are in the proper sense not physical events but rather the grouping of sub-events into a \"greater whole\".\n\n==Working with the development program==\n\n[[File:Fehlende Anmeldung_EN.png|thumb|right|250px|Fig. 1: Search link on employee profile for assigning a development program]]\n\nAll events, which have been assigned to the same development program as the respective employees, are displayed with the help of a special [[Applicant management main page#search links|search link on the]] left border next to the [[Employee file|events of an employee]] (/Employment/Current/ID/Profile/Courses/Profile).\n\nThis search link appears only if a development program has been assigned for the employee.     [[File:Fehlende Teilnehmer Weiterbildungsprogramm_EN.png|thumb|right|250px|Fig. 2: Search link in the event for assigning a development program ]][[File:Teilnehmer-Teilveranstaltung zuweisen_EN.png|thumb|right|250px|Fig. 3: Assign a participant to a sub-event]]<br />[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]]'''Instructions for the Administrator:''' \n\n* If you are working with development programs, the '''development program''' filter must be displayed on the page for an employee's events. Otherwise this search link on the left hand side may not work properly.\n\n:  In the configuration mode, you see the search link block twice! \n\n* In the upper block only non-event administrators see all the events, which:\n\n#  belonged to one of the development programs of the employee and the employee is not yet registered as a participant (even in a sub-event) \n#  have the end date is in the past\n#  have been published as advertisements (for my organization unit, if limited)\n#  and are active\n\n* In the lower block only event administrators see all the events, which belong to one of the development programs of the employee and the employee is not registered as a participant (not even in a sub-event). \n\nThe same applies to the events. Whenever an event becomes part of a development program and this [[Event details|setting]] is assigned to it, a search link of the participants’ overview appears on the left border, which shows the employees who have not yet registered for this event or one of its sub-events.\n\nYou can then do the missing registrations for both the employee and the event. \n\n* An event administrator can also register for events that have not been advertised. \n* In contrast, an event user (manager) and the employee him/herself can only register for advertised events. When registering, one can also register for sub-events.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎|Info.gif‎]] '''Tips for event administrators:''' \n\nIf you wish to make the registrations not on the event itself but on one of its sub-events, you have the option of a multiple action \"Assign people to a sub-event of this event\" on the people overview \"Add participants\" (/Courses/ID/Participants/Assign). You can even navigate further down into the sub-events’ structure by clicking on \"Number of partial events\" in the table.<em></em> <br /><br />\n\n==Logic in structured development programs==\n\nA development program is often composed of various events of which some are interchangeable events (appointments) where, e.g., it is sufficient to attend one event to complete the development program. This makes it possible to develop structured programs.  There are just 2 rules to bear in mind.\n\n*  Once you select an event as being part of the development program of \"Program xy\", all events must be attended (e.g. date) in order to mark the main event as being successfully completed. If you want like to offer, for example, different languages for an event, however, you create a main event with sub-events in the respective different languages ​and mark the sub-events as '''not''' being part of the xy development program. Here, too, If this event is also to have sub-events, participating in one of these sub-events is enough for the main event to qualify as being settled. If there is no sub-event, the event itself must be attended as the sole remaining option.\n*  The maximum depth of sub-events is 4 levels.\n\nIn this way you can design development programs (mandatory event programs) that include both interchangeable components (e.g. dates) and obligatory components.\n\n==Graphic analysis==\n\nTo demonstrate the complexity of the procedure visually, the following graphics are intended to aid understanding:\n\n[[File:Weiterbildungsprogramm A Grafik_EN.png|thumb|left|450px|Fig. 4: Response for a development construct]]<br /><br /><br />\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the adjacent figure 4\n|-\n| \n\nAll events are assigned to the development program A (assignment of the main event 1 to the development program is optional possible, but does not change the procedure of the interaction). Main Event 1 comprises three sub-events. Sub-event 1.3 in turn has two sub-events, and is therefore at the same time also the main event of 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. All events must be attended in order for the main event to be regarded as being settled.\n\n|}\n\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> [[File:Weiterbildungsprogramm B Grafik_EN.png|thumb|left|450px|Fig. 5: None of the events is assigned to a development program.]] <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the adjacent figure 5\n|-\n| \n\nNo event is associated with a / the development program. Sub-event 2.2 in turn is the main event of 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. If a participant attended only event 2.2.1 or 2.1, the main event 2 is deemed to be already settled.\n\n|}\n\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> The following example shows specifically the procedure when searching for events.\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the figure 6 below\n|-\n| \n\nThe events A to G have all been created separately. A, B, C and D are assigned to the same development program. A is a major event which includes sub-events B, C and D. D in turn includes the sub-events E, F and G (of which D is the main event). The search for events proceeds, for an employee who is assigned this development program, according to the following procedures:\n\n* '''Employee is not registered anywhere:  '''<br />In the search, A, B, C and D appear because they are assigned to the development program.\n\n*  '''Employee is already registered for sub-event G:  '''<br />The results of the search are only B and C, since A and D are already marked as being attended due to registration for G (since it does not belong to the development program).\n\n* '''E, F and G are assigned to the development program as well, the employee is registered for G:  '''<br />The search results give B, C, E and F.\n\nRegardless of the search for events, the following procedure applies:\n\n*  '''Date 1 (E) was attended: '''Mouth-to-mouth (D) is deemed to be completely settled because the sub-events E, F and G are not assigned to the development program and therefore the visit to one sub-event is sufficient to highlight the main event \"mouth-to-mouth\" as completed, i.e. only B and C still need to be attended.\n\n|}\n\n[[File:Weiterbildungsprogramm_EN.PNG|thumb|centre|730px|Fig. 6: Event construct with development components]] <br />\n\n==Application examples:==\n*  '''Identical event is offered in different languages:'''<br />\n\n: An event is to be held in different languages, but each employee can select the language in which he wants to attend it. A breakdown in the main event, for example, with the name \"security training\" with the identical sub-events which are offered in German, French and English is particularly optimal here. When attending one of these sub-events, the main event is automatically marked as being settled.\n: &rArr; <em>Refer to figure 7</em>\n\n<br />\n\n*  '''Training program with courses building on each other in the identical language:'''<br />\n\n: The visit of all courses is mandatory, therefore, a development program should be created with main event and sub-events.\n: &rArr; <em>Refer to figure 8</em>\n\n<br />\n\n*  '''Development program with offer of individual components in different languages:'''<br />\n\n: Create a main event with sub-events (different modules of the program which are all associated with the same development program). At the same time, these sub-events have turn have sub-events in different languages, but which are then not assigned to the development program. If now a sub-event is attended in any language offered, the single module is considered to be settled, the remaining modules are still to be attended however.\n: &rArr; <em>Refer to figure 9</em>\n\n<br />\n\n{|class=\"galleryTable noFloat\"\n|-\n|  [[File:Veranstaltung in verschiedenen Sprachen_EN.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Fig. 7: Event is offered in different languages]]\n|  [[File:Weiterbildungsprogramm1_EN.JPEG|thumb|left|250px|Fig. 8: Advanced training program with sub-events whose attendance is mandatory]]\n|  [[File:Weiterbildungsprogramm2_EN.JPEG|thumb|left|250px|Fig. 9: Event with mandatory components in each of the various languages]]\n|}\n\n==Help with repeated development programs==\n*  [[Certificates|Certificates]] with an expiry date: After participating in an event you can issue the participants with a [[Certificates|certificate]] . If you have repeat development programs the employee or the manager him/herself should decide whether a certificate needs to be renewed. Advanced searches for expiring certificates help with this.\n*  [[Reminders|Reminders]]: Setting reminders is an effective method of attending certain development events in time. Optionally, if you define an appropriate reminder, the Haufe solution sends you an e-mail and a reminder in time before a certificate expires.\n*  [[Copy event|Copying development programs]]: If a development program takes place again or if it should have the same set-up as an existing development program, the function \"[[Copy event|Copy event]]\" simplifies the procedure considerably."

You can find additional information about an employee under [[Employee file|Employee file]] or [[Communication with employees|Communication]].\nGeneral settings for the employee review meeting, such as process control and default content settings, can be found in the [[Modules & Accesses|Settings for the employee review meeting]].\n\n==Employee review meeting process==\n* Process preparation by HR when working with competency catalogs: [[Prepare employee review meetings via multiple actions|Prepare employee review meetings via multiple actions]].\n* Process initiated by HR: the hiring managers are asked/reminded by HR to being employee review meetings with their employees.\n* Preparation by managers and the employee: The manager decides whether their goals should be visible for the employee. They can delegate their own goals to the employee, create new goals, or copy goals from earlier agreements or from other employees. The employee receives an email asking them to start thinking about their [[Tasks / job tasks|tasks]] and [[Objectives|goals]]. The employee has the option to view or prepare their [[My employee review meeting|employee review meeting]].\n* Contents that should be part of the employee review meeting for all employees can be copied to individual employees on a recurring basis by assigning [[Function profiles |function profiles]], or individually by hand through the use of [[Employee review meeting catalogs |employee review meeting catalogs]].\n* Meeting: the [[Tasks / job tasks|tasks]] and [[Objectives|goals]] agreed upon in the meeting are entered into Haufe Employee Management by the manager. You can confirm the meeting and its results with the employee in Haufe Employee Management, or print the agreement out and have the employee sign it.\n* Recording the results – Post-processing: After you have made the agreements, you can set up email reminders for yourself. For example, you can receive email reminders for agreed-upon milestones, i.e. on dates when sub-goals are supposed to have been achieved, so that you don't forget about them – but also don't have to constantly check on what sub-goals are due next.\n* Interim check and overview: You can also set up email reminders to check in regularly on goal progress so far.\n* Assessment and determination of bonuses: At the end of the employee review meeting for this period, another meeting takes place. In this meeting, you come to an agreement with the employee as to how well they are accomplishing their [[Tasks / job tasks|tasks]], and whether they are meeting expectations. We support you in the assessment process by [[Average calculations from employee evaluations|calculating averages]]. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] If the contents of the employee review meeting have not all been assessed, or if not all subareas have received an overall assessment, the following warning messages are displayed (as appropriate):<br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:blue\">'''''Caution: Not all contents have been assessed.'''''</span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:blue\">'''''Caution: Not all subareas have received an overall assessment.'''''</span><br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:blue\">'''''Caution: Subareas have contents that have not yet been assessed.'''''</span> \n\nTo learn about administering employee review meetings, see [[Administer employee review meetings|Administer employee review meetings]].\n\n==Subareas of the employee review meeting==\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note on hiding and displaying drop-down elements in the \"Process view\" of the employee review meeting:'''<br>\nPlease note that when [[Configuration mode|hiding or displaying]] elements in the process view with the [[File:Cwcvisibleon.gif]] icon, the change will only be visibly '''after''' the page has been refreshed (e.g. with the F5 key).

This enables you to run the various actions intuitively. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Process view\n! Description/Notes\n|-\n| \n[[File:MAG_Start_DE.png|300px]]\n| The employee review meeting is in its initial stage. Contents are being entered and copied from previous periods. The contents will then be agreed. \n|-\n| \n[[File:MAG_3.png|300px]]\n| This view will be displayed after the contents have been agreed. In this step, a forecast can be given, assessed or the employee review meeting can be completed. \n|-\n| \n[[File:MAG_End_DE.png|300px]]\n| This view will be displayed when the employee review meeting has been completed.\n|-\n| \n[[File:MAG_4.png|450px]]\n| This process view can be [[Configuration mode|shown]] if required. By using this “flag,” employee review meetings that have been completed can be viewed again, and confirmed or accepted, by managers’ managers (see [[#Prozess-Erweiterung: Akzeptieren|Process extension: Accept]]).\n|}\n\n===Process extension: Accept===\nProcess extension: View and accept contents, assessments or completed employee review meeting). \n\nDepending on the time or the progress of the employee review meeting process, the following actions can be displayed (in every subsection): \n* '''Accept contents''' \n: (The contents of the employee review meeting have been recorded and need to be viewed and confirmed.)\n* '''Accept assessment'''\n: (The contents have been assessed and this assessment needs to be viewed and confirmed.)\n* '''Accept employee review meeting''' (see diagram above)\n: (The employee review meeting is complete but needs to be viewed and confirmed.)\n\nIf the manager’s manager clicks “Accept XY,” a confirmation message appears: “Do you want to mark the employee review meeting as checked and accepted up to this point?”. If this message is confirmed, the info message “Checked and accepted by another person” is displayed.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important notes:'''\n* Keep in mind that every additional process step in the employee review meeting also increases the complexity of the process as a whole. We therefore advise that additional “Accept” actions are used as little as possible so that your current processes are not slowed down unnecessarily. To take a specific example: You decide when you want to get a confirmation and show either just “Accept contents,” “Accept assessment,” or “Accept employee review meeting.” \n* These actions only display a “flag” and make no changes and have no effect on existing permissions.\n\n==Copy employee review meeting from another job==\n\n[[User roles in the employee management system|Administrators]] may copy the full employee review meeting of an individual employee to that employee's new job. The following prerequisites and notes should be kept in mind here.\n\n'''Prerequisites''' \n* A new [[Job profile (employee management)|position profile]] has already been assigned to the employee.\n* No employee review meeting contents have been created yet for the new job profile.\n\n'''Notes:'''\n* Only [[User roles in the employee management system|administrators]] can copy full employee review meetings. \n* When an employee review meeting is copied to a new position profile, the employee review meeting is set to the status \"Suspended\" in the old position profile, and no further tasks are pending. \n* If there are any outstanding [[Third-party evaluation|third-party assessments]] for the previous job, the invitations (for the current job) need to be re-sent. \n\nIf all prerequisites are met and you have complied with the above notes, you will be able to select the affected employee (with their newly assigned position profile) in the [[Employee directory|employee directory]]. In the \"Employee review meetings\" (or \"Performance reviews\") tab, you will then see the option to '''''Copy employee review meeting from another job''''' for this employee. When you click on this link, an overview of all of this employee's other/previous jobs will be displayed, with information about the job number, job title, function profile, manager, organizational unit, etc. Select the job from which you would like to copy the employee review meeting and click on \"'''Copy employee review meeting'''\".\n\n==Actions==\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Uploading documents'''\n: When creating or assessing subareas of the employee review meeting, you have the option to upload documents. In this way, both employees and managers can upload relevant documents, e.g. when creating goals (or other subareas).\n  \n* Agree on employee review meeting\n* Modify agreement\n* Complete the employee review meeting\n* Modify assessment\n* Ask employee to create content\n* Ask employee for confirmation\n* Ask employee for interim outlook\n* Ask employee for assessment\n* Ask employee to confirm the assessment\n* Agree\n* Modify agreement\n* Confirm agreement <br> [[File:info.gif]]'''Note:''' People who agree on contents cannot also confirm them at the same time. This should always be done by the other person involved.\n* Complete the assessment \n* Suspend assessment (no employee assessment will be done for this period) <br>[[File:info.gif]] Suspended employee review meetings can be \"opened\" again by first \"completing\" them and then reopening them (via the \"Modify assessment\" link). \n* Modify assessment\n* Copy potential assessment for [current period] from previous assessment\n* [[Calculate bonus & salary XY|Calculate bonus & salary XY]]\n* Adopt suggestions for bonus & salary [current period]<br>\n\n===Request action for each subarea===\nWithin the employee review meeting, you can start a communication from any subarea and ask the employee to take appropriate action. For this feature, the new “Communication with employee” section contains the following actions: \n* Prompt employee to create content\n* Prompt employee to confirm \n* Prompt employee to enter their likely achievement \n* Prompt employee to make an assessment\n* Prompt employee to confirm the assessment \n\n[[File:info.gif]] The available actions are conditional and will be displayed (if [[Configuration mode|unhidden]]) depending on the progress.\n\n===Sharing assessments===\nIn the [[Modules & Accesses|Employee review meeting settings]], you can set both the '''visibility of the manager's assessment in the employee view''' and the '''visibility of the self-assessment in the manager view'''. <br>\n[[File:info.gif]] If you select setting '''number 2''' here (= assessment is only visible after being explicitly shared by the manager/employee), an additional checkbox will then appear in every assessment screen: \n* '''Share assessment now''' \n: This gives the person (who is currently assessing content from the employee review meeting) the option to share the assessment immediately. If the checkbox is not used to share the assessment, a note will appear in the view of the employee review meeting with the following text about the option to share it:\n:''[[File:attention.gif]] Note: Your assessment has not yet been shared for viewing. Please share it at the appropriate time. Share now''\n\n===Integrated employee review meeting: Complete and agree simultaneously===\n* '''Integrated employee review meeting''' \n:'''Complete''' ''(current period)''\n:''Agree''''' (following period)''' \nIn the Actions (through the \"Integrated employee review meeting\" link), you have the option to complete all contents for the current period (assessments for performance and development goals, tasks and competencies, and the overall assessment),''' and to agree on the contents for '''the following period at the same time''''''. If you have already completed some of the contents for the current period (e.g. goals), they will not be affected.<br>\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note:''' If you agree on contents, those contents will be marked in the employee view as \"not visible for employee\". Contents that the employee has marked as \"visible only to me\" are deleted.<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] This link (if [[Configuration mode|displayed]]) is only available for the current period and the following period.\n\n==Preparation by the administrator==\n* In preparation for the employee review meeting, the administrator must [[Create new period|create a period]] in the settings. \n* Many processes run more smoothly if this new period is also defined as a current period. Wizards can be constructed more dynamically if you simply make use of the current period each year.\n* In addition, the [[Calculation formulae|calculation formulas]] should be ready for use, since a calculation formula for calculating appropriate [[Salary & Bonus|compensation]] for the employee's performance is a part of the agreement.\n* [[Employee review meeting catalogs|Employee review meeting catalogs]] should be ready for use in all necessary languages. These catalogs can also be bundled into [[Function profiles |function profiles]], and then linked to the relevant employee's position profile.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Modules & Accesses|Settings for employee review meeting]].\n* [[Employee review meeting catalogs|Employee review meeting catalogs]]\n* [[Administer employee review meetings|Administer employee review meetings]]"

Employee review meeting catalogs that are linked with function profiles can then be supplemented with [[Employee review meeting catalogs#Define target values for competencies|target values]] specific to each function profile. \nYou have two options for assigning employee review meeting catalogs:\n\n*'''Copy employee review meeting catalogs directly to employee for assessment:''' You can find this copy function as a multiple action in the employee overview, and as a single action in the employee review meeting for each individual employee. However, catalogs must be reassigned for every new assessment period; depending on the complexity, this may involve a certain degree of effort, and therefore a risk of errors as well.<br />\n*'''Assignment via function profiles:''' You can also assign the employee review meeting catalogs directly under the function profiles using the appropriate function profile request.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] Employee review meeting catalogs can be completed in multiple languages. If you use the catalogs for the employee in their ERM, however, they will only be copied over in the employee’s language. If the employee’s language has not been defined, then the default language specified in the settings for the solution as a whole will be used.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] In order to be able to edit the contents of a given function profile, the catalog status must be set to “Processing”.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] If the list contains target values, they should be displayed in the assessment screens of the employee review meeting (see [[Configuration mode|Configuration mode]]).\n\n==Copy employee review meeting catalog== \nSince the contents of employee review meeting catalogs often differ in just a few but important points, it is possible to copy an entire catalog with all its contents and then make the desired changes to the copy — for example, the copied employee review meeting catalog can simply be divided into two or more catalogs using this technique. With this approach, there is no need to create a new employee review meeting catalog that differs in only a few points from an existing one by copying and pasting the individual content items.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] This action is only available for the [[User roles in the employee management system#HR expert|HR expert]] and [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|Administrator]] user roles.\n\n==Import employee review meeting catalogs== \nYou have the option of importing employee review catalogs. You will find this option in the “Imports” (''/Import'') section of your Haufe employee management solution. Use the corresponding [[Imports in Employee Management#Employee review meeting catalogues|Import Template]] and specify your information about the respective employee review catalog (name, type, number, etc.) there.\n\n==Define target values for competencies==\nTarget values are a useful way to define guidelines for [[Function profiles|function profiles]], which employees in those profiles should try to meet as effectively as possible.\n\nA relative assessment in the ERM with selection values like “achieved” or “exceeded” is especially useful for specifying requirements in function profiles, or for comparing target values to a given employee’s results or to the employee review meeting catalog. \nThe scale for assessing the target values can either be a relative scale (“achieved”, “exceeded”, etc.) or an absolute scale (points, letter grades, etc.). This assessment also requires a legend in which the scale (e.g. grades, points, etc.) is explained.\n\n*'''Relative assessment example:'''\nCompetency: “Communication”, target value/description: “Confident manner when presenting to department and committees, clear presentation style, open and honest manner”, assessment: “achieved”\n\n*'''Absolute assessment example:'''\nCompetency: “Communication”, target value: “3”, assessment: “5”\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] If your company uses particularly extensive competency catalogs in which not all entries in each function profile are relevant, you can enter a target value to ensure that only the relevant values are copied to the [[Employee review meeting|employee review meeting]] for use in the actual assessment. To do this, click on “Set target values” in a function profile, then check the box for “Only assess entries with target values” in the settings. If you now copy content to the [[Employee review meeting|employee review meeting]], any contents without a target value will be ignored.\n\n==Include ERM catalog contents in ERM==\nIn preparation for an employee review meeting, you can copy all the employee review meeting contents that are linked in function profiles to the relevant agreement period. They can then be customized if needed, and agreed upon later with the employee. One advantage of copying the contents is that even in catalogs that change over the years, the contents that were assessed at the time are always retained in the original, as well as the target values.\n\n'''Proceed as follows:'''\n* Select specific employees in the employee directory<br />\n* multiple action: “Copy contents from function profiles” and/or \n* multiple action: “Copy contents from employee review meeting catalog”\n[[File:info.gif]]'''Note:''' If the [[Employee review meeting|employee review meetings]] have already been agreed upon, you must force the content to be added with the “Copy and update content” action. ERMs that have already been agreed upon are reopened for the newly added contents and agreed upon again.\n* When selecting the multiple action “Copy contents from employee review meeting catalog” and then clicking on “Use”, you can select the option to “''Delete other content''”. If you check this box, all existing content from the area affected by the employee review meeting catalog will be deleted. '''All''' the content from a given section can be replaced, even if it does not originally come from this employee review meeting catalog.\n\n==Specify requirements for general skills==\nThe employee file also contains a “Skills” section that offers various lists to assess the employee’s skills. These can be filled out by employees themselves or by their managers. These skill assessments provide a useful basis for your company to catalog your employees’ skills, and to compare them with a “target profile” for each employee’s assigned function profile. Once you have set up this connection, a graphic appears in the “Skills” tab in the employee file that shows how well the employee currently matches with the corresponding function profile. Targeted training and development actions can then be taken if necessary. \n\nOnce an employee has been linked to a function profile, the same graphic will appear in that function profile under the “Requirements” tab; in this case, however, it shows the average values for all employees assigned to this function profile. This lets you see what sorts of training courses might be advisable for your company. In addition, [[Event analyses|evaluating events]] can also help you to assess the effectiveness of an [[Events|event]] and to improve it accordingly if needed.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Function profiles|Function profiles]]\n* [[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]"

The course then reports to Umantis that the participant has either reached a milestone in the course or come to the end. Currently, the system checks the point score and status achieved by the participant.\nIf you would like to automatically set a specific participation status or the “Participated” status after every participation in this online course, create a '''condition''' by filling out the following section here:\n\n; Conditions for executing action block 1 for this online course\n[[File:info.gif]] For conditional actions, fill out at least one of the two fields “Online course status” or “Online course result”. The available values are dependent on the specific online course.\t\n\n* '''Online course status'''\n: “Status” return value: This value is taken from a special predefined list of possible statuses. After reaching a certain status, a participation status appropriate for your system can be written automatically. If any status other than the one you selected has been reached at the time of the event, action block 2 will be executed. \n:* Passed \n:* Completed\n:* Not passed\n:* Incomplete\n:* Viewed\n:* Started\n\n* '''Minimum online course result (points or %)\n: “Point score” return value: For online courses that offer a maximum number of points, the result achieved is calculated as a percentage.

To do this, you must also configure [[Certificates#Certificate settings|certificate settings]] for this online course. \n\n'''Action block 2: If the conditions specified above are NOT met''':\n* '''New participation status'''\n: Define the new participation status. \n* '''Mark as “Participated”'''\n: Check this box if you want “Participated” marking to be applied when a participant '''does not pass''' the online course.\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf you enter an [[Online course for an event|online course]], participants can start and go through it after registering.\n\nAn '''automatic''' participation status can be set up here after every participation in an online course. The action can optionally be associated with conditions by clicking on the required online course status, or by entering the required result of the online course. \n\n; Conditions for passing the online course\n[[File:info.gif]] For conditional actions, fill out at least one of the two fields “Online course status” or “Online course result”. The available values are dependent on the specific online course.\t\n\n* '''Online course status'''\n: Online courses have return values in the form of their own status from the following list. After reaching a certain status, a participation status appropriate for your system can be written automatically. \n:* Passed \n:* Completed\n:* Not passed\n:* Incomplete\n:* Viewed\n:* Not started\n\n* '''Online course result or Online course result in %'''\t\n: For online courses that offer a maximum number of points, the result achieved is calculated as a percentage. \n\n; If the participant passed the online course, or if no conditions were defined:\n* '''New participation status'''\n: Define the new participation status here. \n* '''Mark as “Participated”'''\n: Check this box if you want “Participated” marking to be applied when a participant passes the online course (or when no conditions are defined).  \n\n; If the participant did not pass the online course:\n* '''New participation status'''\n: Define the new participation status. \n* '''Mark as “Participated”'''\n: Check this box if you want “Participated” marking to be applied when a participant '''does not pass''' the online course.\n\n==Certificate settings==\nThe settings in this view define the title, period of validity, and document category of the [[Certificates|certificates]] that participants can obtain from this event.\n'''Caution:''' Please note that a certificate can only be created if a certificate title has been entered.\n\nCertificate templates are available under the [[Communication|Communication]] > [[Templates|Templates]] tab ('''/Communications/Templates'''). More information on the creation, maintenance and use of certificates is available on the overview page for [[Certificates|Certificates]].\n\nYou can enter the following settings for the certificate for an event: \n\n'''Certificate for this event'''\n* '''Certificate title*'''\n: If you wish to create certificates later, then you must have a title.\n* '''Document category'''\n: Type of document, e.g. certificate, application documents, etc.\n* '''Valid from'''\n: Date from which the certificate is valid. This value takes precedence over the dynamically generated validity period (length in days). \n* '''Valid until'''\n: Date until which the certificate is valid. This value takes precedence over the dynamically generated validity period (length in days). \n* '''Period of validity in days (dynamic)'''\n: When setting a certificate’s period of validity, you have the option to enter the period length dynamically: If you manually enter the length of the validity period (in days) for the certificate, the date when its validity expires is calculated automatically. In this case, the certificate becomes valid at the time when it is issued, and remains valid until the specified number of days have passed. For example, when creating a session within an event on this approach, the period of validity is automatically copied over from the main event, so you do not have to manually calculate and enter the “Valid until” date for event sessions.\n* '''Document'''\n: You can optionally place a custom document template here, in RTF format, for the certificate to be created later. Use variables to allow participant information, valid dates, or even a certificate header to be populated into the document dynamically. If you do not place a document here, then you have the option to dynamically select a certificate template from the central settings when creating certificates.\n\n'''Certificate required as prerequisite for this event''' \n* '''Document category'''\t\n: Choose a document category here that will later serve as a prerequisite for participation in the event. Event participants that do not have this document category will be advised of the missing prerequisite when registering for the event.\n\n==Instructors==\nIn this section, you can assign [[Instructors|instructors]] and specify the booking period. After assigning instructors, you can then view a table with an overview of the instructors assigned to this event, with additional information and [[#Mehrfachaktionen|available actions]].\n\n====Instructor’s visibility in the event posting====\n[[File:eye.png]] - If the eye icon is displayed, then the assigned instructor is visible in the [[Publish an event|event posting]]. You can use the multiple actions ''Show in event posting profile'' and ''Do not show in event posting profile'' to specify whether or not the instructor(s) should be displayed in the event posting.\n\n====Information about instructors and booking times====\nOther person- and booking-related information is displayed in the table (if [[Configuration mode|displayed]]), e.g. image, salutation, title before name, name, email, language, place of residence, workplace, telephone number, fax number, subject areas, booking times 1 to 3 (with start and end).\n\n====Multiple actions====\nThe following multiple actions are available:\n* ''Change booking times''\n: [[File:info.gif]] You can change booking times either directly by using the multiple action, or via [[File:edit.GIF|20px]] at the bottom of the table.\n* ''Show in event posting profile''\n* ''Do not show in event posting profile''\n* ''Send email(s) from template''\n* ''Create letter(s) from template''\n* ''Remove booking''\n\n==Reserved resources==\n\nMore information under: [[Resources|Resources]]\n\n==Linked events==\nA dashboard can be [[Configuration mode|inserted]] in this section to show all linked events. These can be either [[Event details#Prerequisite events|prerequisite events]] or [[Event details#Following events |following events]]. This makes it possible to build complete sequences of events in which individual events build on one another.<br> \n\n'''Example:'''\n\n[[File:Verbundene_Veranstaltungen.png|1000px]]\n\n[[File:info.gif]] In Umantis, click on the icon for an event to open its detailed view.\n\n'''Available actions'''\n* To add more prerequisite events, click on '''+''' ''Add prerequisite events'' on the left side of the dashboard.\n* To add more following events, click on '''+''' ''Add following event'' on the right side of the dashboard.\n\n===Prerequisite events===\nThe \"Prerequisite events\" section is used to enter events that are intended as prerequisites for participating in the event displayed in the detailed view. The administrator of an event that requires prior participation in other events can then see in the participant list which participants do not meet one or more requirements for the event. The function also includes a filter, “Meets requirements for event”, which can be selected when adding participants to an event.\n\nTo add one or more prerequisite events, click on \"'''+'''Add prerequisite events\" in this section, then select the appropriate events in the events overview. Select events by checking their boxes and executing the multiple action \"Assign\".\n\n===Following events===\nThe \"Following events\" section can be used to enter following events. To add one or more following events, click on \"'''+'''Add following events\" in this section, then select the appropriate events in the events overview. Select events by checking their boxes and executing the multiple action \"Assign\".\n\n==Event is part of==\nInformation in this section indicates whether the currently displayed event is a session in a larger event. If so, the main event(s) to which it belongs are listed here. \nYou can click on \"'''+''' Add main events\" to add a main event.\n\n==Event sessions==\nThe event sessions belonging to the current main event are displayed in this section. Clicking on “'''+''' Add event session” allows you to assign an already active event as an event session within the current main event, or to create a new event session. When creating a new event session, just as when [[Create event|creating]] a main event, you can enter basic information about the event session.\n\nWhen assigning event sessions, you can click on the “'''+ Create and assign multiple event sessions (dates)'''” action to enter the basic information for the event sessions, and also use the “'''Event session start and end dates'''” section to add multiple event sessions with different dates at the same time.

The deletion affects only persons who are effectively present in the import, i.e. if nothing is imported for a person, the corresponding CV data is not deleted either.\n* PARAMID-LOOP-START and PARAMID-LOOP-END must be removed from all XML templates for import (they are only required for export).\n\n====Notes on importing certificates====\n\n'''Event imports provide the following variables relating to certificates:'''\n:: Veranstaltung.ZertifikatTitel\n:: Veranstaltung.ZertifikatKategorie\n:: Veranstaltung.ZertifikatGueltigVon\n:: Veranstaltung.ZertifikatGueltigBis\n: (No physical document can be imported!)\n: [[File:info.gif]] This import overwrites existing content, since it is not a document collection but merely the template for the certificates to be generated later.\n\n'''Participation imports provide the following variables relating to certificates:'''\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentTitel\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentKategorie\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentGueltigVon\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentGueltigBis\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentBemerkung\n:: Veranstaltung.TeilnahmeDokumentVeranstaltungID (-> requires Haufe ID from the URL for the event you want to link to)\n: (No physical document can be imported!)\n: [[File:info.gif]] This import '''does not overwrite existing content''', i.e. if you import multiple times, then multiple document entries will be created.\n\n'''Person/employee imports provide the following variables relating to certificates:'''\n:: Person.Dokument (physical document)\n:: Person.DokumentTitel\n:: Person.DokumentGueltigVon\n:: Person.DokumentGueltigBis\n:: Person.DokumentKategorie\n:: Person.DokumentSichtbarFuerMitarbeiter\n:: Person.DokumentSichtbarFuerVorgesetzte\n:: Person.DokumentBemerkung\n:: Person.DokumentVeranstaltungID (-> requires Haufe ID from the URL for the event you want to link to)\n: [[File:info.gif]] This import '''does not overwrite existing content''', i.e. if you import multiple times, then multiple document entries will be created.\n: [[File:info.gif]] The benefit of linking a document to an event via ''Person.DokumentVeranstaltungID'' is that these entries (document compilations) can also be overwritten again by a newly created certificate. Through this link (person/certificate/event), the collection can therefore be deleted before the new item is created.\n\n===Special cases===\nIf you would like to mark certain fields as [[Imports in Employee Management#Exception rule for importing employees|not to be overwritten]] during an import, assign certain [[Imports in Employee Management#Employee/Event import: Assigning selection values|selection values]] to employees or events, or if [[Imports in Employee Management#Transfer/Transferring / restructuring via an import|your company’s structure]] is changing, refer the following explanations for help with the import process.\n====Exception rule for importing employees====\nAs an administrator, you can specify individual fields that are not to be overwritten during an import in the [[Settings in employee file|Settings]] in the respective employee file.\nThis applies to the following five fields:\n* Role\n* Language\n* Access to modules\n* Access to organizational units\n* Manager\n\n====Employee/Event import: Assigning selection values====\n\nA number of special situations can arise when assigning selection values in the employee or event import. If you wish to assign values from selection lists, e.g. of organizational units, using the master data import, you essentially have three ways to identify the value:\n* '''Haufe ID''' for the value (corresponds to the ID’s entry in the database and is usually not known to the source system)\n* '''code''' for the value (usually specified by the source system so it can be passed directly)\n* '''text''' of the selection value in all available languages\n<br>\n\nMany fields have a multi-select that can also be imported. One example for this kind of field is “Access to organizational units”. The default separator here is a comma, which is also used in data export. However, if you wish to use a comma in the selection value itself, you may no longer use the comma as a separator. You can choose from four separators as selection values, namely , ; | ¦. If one of the characters appears in one of the values, it can no longer be used as a separator. Export variables that end with the name Reimport or ReimportCode are already able to find both the source system and the appropriate separator for the values to allow for a problem-free re-import, and to export them. \n\nThe following export variables currently exist: \n*[Stelle.OrganisationseinheitReimportCode]\n*[Stelle.Organisationseinheit2ReimportCode]\n*[Stelle.MatrixOrganisationseinheitReimportCode]\n*[Stelle.MatrixOrganisationseinheit2ReimportCode]\n*[Person.ZugriffAufOrgEinheitReimportCode]\n*[Person.ZugriffAufMatrixOrgEinheitReimportCode]\n*[Stelle.OrganisationseinheitReimport]\n*[Stelle.Organisationseinheit2Reimport]\n*[Stelle.MatrixOrganisationseinheitReimport]\n*[Stelle.MatrixOrganisationseinheit2Reimport]\n*[Person.ZugriffAufOrgEinheitReimport]\n*[Person.ZugriffAufMatrixOrgEinheitReimport]\n*[Veranstaltung.OrgEinheitReimport]\n*[Veranstaltung.OrgEinheitReimportCode]\n\n<br>\n''Example: Access to organizational units:''<br>\n* OU Berlin, OU London, OU NewYork => can be imported like this without any problem.\n* OU Berlin(East,West), OU London, OU NewYork  => '''cannot''' be imported this way, because OU Berlin(East,West) already includes a comma, and so each of the individual values needs to be separated using one of the other separators. \n* OU Berlin(East,West); OU London; OU NewYork => Is permitted, as the comma only appears in the value to be imported, and the import procedure can therefore be processed correctly.\n\n<br>\nBecause the '''Organizational units''' and '''Matrix organizational units''' lists can be imported from different source systems, a source system key is created to avoid overlapping values.\nThis source system key \n* is defined for all the values together, using the import variable Lists.SourceSystemKey (e.g.: Lists.SourceSystemKey=SAP) or\n* uses a special notation style for each value, such as “OU London@@umantis;OU NewYork@@SAP” ('''@@''' separates the source system from the value),\nthereby ensuring a unique association. The source system key may not contain any of the separator characters (''',''' ''';''' '''|''' '''¦''').\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Lists 66 and 67 (organizational units and matrix organizational units) must be filled in/imported in all used languages, because access control via organizational units takes the user language into account.\n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Only lists 66 and 67 (organizational units and matrix organizational units) may have source system keys. \nOf course, imports can be done without a source system key in less complex systems. \n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] Importing a record (of an employee) is blocked if a selection value was not found. You can see whether all values were imported from the difference in the counts for “Process entries: ok (14)” and “Write entries: ok (13)” (/Import/ID/Profile). In this case, 14 records were sent, but 1 record was completely ignored because of a mismatch. This means you have constant control over the import process.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The [[Event details|Event details]] contain additional information about administrative access via organizational units and matrix organizational units and the associated import variables ([Veranstaltung.OrgEinheit],[Veranstaltung.AusschreibungFuerOrgEinheit], or [Veranstaltung.MatrixOrgEinheitPlusUntergeordnete], [Veranstaltung.MatrixOrgEinheit])\n\n====Transferring / restructuring via an import====\nIf corporate divisions are merged, the source system changes, or an employee switches from one source system to another, this should be taken into consideration when importing. Then you have the option of using a transfer by means of an import (XML or Excel). You can use the existing import keys once to find the employees in Haufe, and then assign new import keys to each of these employees using the import variables (Job.NewKey, Person.NewKey, SourceSystem.NewKey). The import keys can be changed manually any time in the employee file settings, however, this involves quite a bit of additional effort.<br>\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' In (advanced) searches for user IDs, source system keys and job IDs, search terms are case-sensitive. For example, if the user ID is written in lowercase in the import, then you must also use lowercase when searching for it. \n<br><br>\n'''Proceed as follows:'''<br>\n# Use the variables Job.Key, Person.Key and SourceSystem. Key to find the employees affected by the change, as this is the only way to guarantee unique identification. \n# To modify the source system key, add a new column with the name Quellsystem.NeuerSchluessel to the Excel document and then assign a new key to the employees in this column. The import searches for the employees using the old keys first, and then overwrites the indicated keys. Not all keys must be overwritten; instead, for example, you could use and overwrite only Quellsystem.NeuerSchluessel, or only Person.NeuerSchluessel. You cannot delete a key, only change it. Because no uniqueness check is performed, you must make sure to assign a unique Person.Schluessel and Quellsystem.Schluessel for the employee within the solution.\n<br>\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] After you have run the change import, any future import for the employee will no longer find the employee in the system using the old key combination. Therefore, it will create the record again (i.e. duplicate it) using the old keys. For this reason, the import file that has been used for the change can only be used once, and reconciliation with the regular master data import is mandatory. In the event that an import fails, it can be corrected either manually or via another change import (provided the key combinations are unique)."

Employee and supervisor portraits based thereon promote cooperation and mutual understanding. With the portraits you will be able to better understand the actions and decisions of your colleagues.\n\nEvery successful business needs a variety of talents. Problems of understanding between different personalities (Sales - production, visionary - expert, CEO - CFO), however, unnecessarily reduce productivity. But by visualising the different motivations of colleagues, employees, applicants and other partners and the systematic IPM skills management, it is possible to optimally use the respective capabilities of employees to increase the understanding of different personalities and thus not only increase the satisfaction of employees, but especially the productivity of the company. IPM works with modern technology that can be used by any employee to profitably use a better understanding of different personalities in their daily work throughout the company.\n\n=Performance description=\n\nThe employee has the option to jump from his own employee profile in Haufe talent management via the link \"IPM Portrait\" into his IPM motivation profile. If the employee has not yet entered a self-portrait, he will be forwarded to a new window and directly to the appropriate form. Once this self-portrait is entered, the link \"IPM Portrait\" directly connects to one's own motivation profile. \n\nIf the self-portrait is completed, the employee can share his/her motivation profile with HR and authorized managers - on: «Share my IPM Profile for HR and supervisors». If the module «[[Network|Network]]» is shared, the employee can share his motivation profile at the same time also for all colleagues: «Share my IPM Profile in the network».\n\nIn the respective [[Employee file|Employee profile]] , managers and supervisor in their authorized access may skip to the motivation profiles which were shared by the employees themselves. Accordingly, each employee has the opportunity to jump off from the employee profile of a colleague in the network module into the motivational profile that has been shared by this employee.\n\n=Jump Link=\n\nCurrent link is implemented via [[Parse links|Parse links]] : <nowiki>http://ipm-profil.de/portrait/</nowiki>[Authentifikationsschlüssel],[IPM-Kundennummer],[Person.Nummer],[Person.Vorname],[Person.Nachname],[Person.AnredeRefc],5\n\n*  The jump into IPM is always via the same link.\n*  Construction of the link: MD5 authentication (customer#+timestamp), the person to be viewed (name, first name), umantisID (TAK), Sir/Madam, speech parameter user language, type: Employee\n*  The type allows to control which view on the data is shown. (Full list of types)<br /> \n\n: The jump link is available:\n: a) in Self-service, where only the EMP him/herself can jump (permanently offered),\n: b) in addition to the internal profile view of an employee, where authorized, HR and MAN can jump, and\n: c) in addition on the profile view in the self-service network where all employees can navigate to the motivational profile\n\n=Sharing the personal motivation profile=\n\nThe employee himself can control whether the link in the options b) and/or c) is offered. This occurs via a general functional extension of the pars link. One pars link each on the personal profile in the internal profile view and in the profile view network can be activated by the employee. The activation is performed in the self-service user personal profile via Edit with multi-select (check-box) \"Share jump link\" via a new fixed list with the selection list values:\n\n*  ParsLink 107\n*  ParsLink 108\n*  ParsLink 123\n\n==Related subjects==\n* [[CV parsing|CV parsing]]\n* [[LinkedIn|LinkedIn]]\n* [[Xing|Xing]]\n* [[Aconso - Digital personnel file|Aconso - Digital personnel file]]\n* [[Job platform providers|Job platform providers]]\n* [[Video interview - Interview suite by viasto|Video interview - interview suite by viasto]]"

A job can be labeled as a key position directly in the job itself.\n\n==Identification of key positions==\nThe job’s relevance and the risk of vacancy are the two defining elements in the identification of critical key positions. A job’s relevance determines whether it is a key position, and the risk of vacancy allows for conclusions about the danger of a vacancy in a given job.\n\n'''Note:'''\n* '''Job relevance''': The relevance of a job is dependent on multiple factors (e.g. know-how, experience) and is often positively correlated with its hierarchical level within the organization. Factors like the availability of potential employees, and the development time that an employee needs before reaching their actual productive level of performance, are critical in determining whether a job should be labeled as a key position.\n* '''Determining risk of vacancy''': The risk of vacancy can be determined from the current job holder’s risk of leaving. If there is a strong risk that the job will be vacant or that an employee will leave, the importance of the given job can provide a hint as to whether it makes sense to initiate [[Succession planning|succession planning]]. The employee review meeting is an appropriate platform for determining an employee’s risk of leaving. \nIn the “Employee review meeting” tab, under the employee’s potential, the risk of leaving can be indicated on a scale.\n\nOnce the company’s (critical) key positions have been identified, potential successors for these jobs can be determined by means of [[Succession planning|succession planning]].\n\n==Defining key positions==\nYou can label a job as a key position directly in the job profile for the given job. You can also go through the job directory and use a multiple action to define jobs as key positions, or to remove their key position status.\n\nJobs marked as key positions are marked with a key icon in the job directory.\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[Vacancy notice (employee management)|Publish job (Employee Management)]]\n*[[Succession planning|Succession planning]]\n*[[Function profiles|Function profiles]]\n*[[Employee review meeting catalogs|Employee review meeting catalogs]]\n*[[Potential|Potential]]\n*[[Staff positions|Staff positions]]\n*[[Organigram|Org chart]]"

You can use the language settings to specify the languages in which users should be able to use the solution. The languages that are activated there are available to every [[User profile|user]] and every [[Settings in employee file|employee]] in the personal settings as possible user languages (except for ''[[Languages#“Lite” languages|partially supported languages]]).<br>\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Configure languages==\nClick on [[File:edit.GIF|20px]] in the “Configure languages” section to configure the language settings. You can then view all languages available for selection, and: \n* ''[[Languages#Change the language selection|Change the language selection]]''\n* ''Change language for existing individuals''\n* ''[[Languages#Umantis default language|Define the default language for umantis]]''\n\n===Change the language selection===\n* '''Fully supported languages'''\n: Here you will see a list of the core languages that are currently available/supported in Umantis \n\n* '''[[#LITE Sprachen|Partially supported languages]]'''\n: Here you will see a list of partially supported or “lite” languages. \n: [[File:attention.gif]] For more information, please see the section on [[#LITE Sprachen|“Lite” languages]]\n\n* '''Other languages'''\n: Here you will see a list of other languages\n\n===Umantis default language===\nThe '''default language''' for a solution serves as a fallback language, and is used when a page is not explicitly called up in a specific language through the use of parameters or of the user language.\n\n\n----\n==[[File:Globe Icon.PNG]] Select language==\nYou can easily change your user language and time zone by clicking on the [[File:Globe Icon.PNG|15px]] icon at the top right in the system navigation bar for your Umantis solution. The language that was defined as the default language for this Umantis solution is always displayed without a translation when selecting the language here. For all other languages that are available as user languages, each language’s name for itself is also shown — and the same logic applies to time zones, which you can also change here. This ensures that you will always understand at least one of the two language names displayed. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] As always, you can also change the user language through your own [[User profile|user profile]].<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] You can use configuration mode to [[User profile|show or hide]] the icon, and to indicate whether or not time zone information should be displayed. \n----\n\n==“Lite” languages==\nLanguages that are only partially supported are referred to as “lite” languages. They are only available for certain sections of the solution, and can '''only''' be selected by the [[Access for applicant|applicant]] as a user language. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] Lite languages are currently available in the following sections of Umantis Applicant Management:\n* [[Positions published externally#External job board|Job board]]\n* [[Access for applicant|Applicant access]]\n* [[Application forms|Application forms]]\n* [[Job advertisement contents|Publication contents]]\n* [[Selection criteria|Selection criteria]] / Questions about the job\n* [[Advertisement layouts|Job posting layouts]]\n* [[Integration & Design|Design settings]]\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please note that a “lite” (partially supported) language should '''not''' be [[Imports|imported]] as a user language.\n\n==Integration tips==\n* You must choose a ''single'' variant of the German language. The available versions are “Deutsch (CH)” for Switzerland or “Deutsch (DE)” for Germany. The two variants of German cannot both be activated at the same time, since everywhere that users can switch between the languages, the specific variant is not shown (for improved legibility), and only the general term “German” is displayed.\n* When integrating pages or sending links to pages in the solution, the desired language can be included as a parameter with a link. The parameter is “'''?lang='''”. The value for the language parameter is one of the language codes from the list below:\n\n==List of languages==\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Notes:'''\n* The table contains a list of the languages supported for each application. \n* This list includes both the standard languages and those that must be purchased separately.\n* The contents of the table are in alphabetical order (“Language” column).\n* An “X” means that the language is available for the given application.\n* If a language is available for “Applicant Management”, then it is automatically available for the “Applicant Management Lite” version as well.\n* If a language that you want to use is not available, please consult with your contact at Umantis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;

Each profile should have a label that is as informative as possible, so that a user can rely on these labels when selecting among their profiles and be sure to select the right access profile.\n\nThis additional access profile is only an extension of a user profile, and does not exist as an independent user, i.e. the permissions associated with the main profile remain unchanged and are supplemented with the permissions from the additional role. It can also be added to or removed from the user’s profile by means of an [[Imports|employee import]].\n\n==Set up status as alternate [[File:Schloss_16.png]] (available in Employee Management only)==\nSimilarly to an additional profile with its own access rights, any user can be set up as an ‘alternate’ or ‘representative’ for another user. \nThe alternate will then see a link to “CHANGE USER” at the very top of the navigation menu. The employee can use this link to change to the alternate profile and perform actions with the same rights as the employee they are an alternate for, but still under their own name. [[File:Info.gif‎]] When switching to “My Profile”, the alternate returns to their own profile and not that of the employee they are an alternate for. \n\nThe additional profile as an alternate can also be added or deleted by means of an [[Imports|employee import]].\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The link \"Set up representation\" has a condition and is only displayed for [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|administrators]].\n\n==Set up linked user profiles within Umantis [[File:Schloss_16.png]]==\nIn contrast to the additional access profile, a linked user profile involves a link between two full-fledged user profiles. Both user profiles therefore must be created before they can be linked. Another precondition for linking two user profiles is that a third-party system must be set up. This is required even if the users to be linked belong to the same Umantis solution. Register the third-party system in the settings under [[Interfaces|Interfaces]].\n\nNext, navigate to one of the two [[User profile|user profiles]] to be linked, or into the [[Settings in employee file|settings]] of that employee profile, and click on ''Set up access to another user profile in ...'' To link to a profile in Applicant Management, all you need is a maximally informative label for the profile to be linked, the user ID of the profile to be linked, the home page where the user should land after switching, and the choice of third-party system that the profile to be linked belongs to. To link to a profile in Employee Management, you will also need the source system key of the profile to be linked. You can find it in the settings for the employee from which you want to create a new link. \n\n[[File:Info.gif‎]] When linking two user profiles, the connection should be set up in each of the two profiles to point to the other. This is the only way to ensure that the user can switch back to their original profile after having switched to another.\n\n==Link a Umantis user profile with a profile on a third-party system==\nIf you want to allow a user to switch from Umantis to a third-party system with a single click, you can go into the settings and set up a direct link in HTML by clicking on ''Set up third-party system'' under [[Interfaces|Interfaces]]. You can use up to five parameters that can later be saved for each user link. \n\nNext, navigate to one of the two [[User profile|user profiles]] to be linked, or into the [[Settings in employee file|settings]] of that employee profile, and click on ''Set up access to another user profile in third-party system''. There, in addition to a maximally informative label for the profile, you must enter up to five additional parameters, depending on the third-party system.\n\n==Switch between linked profiles==\nOnce a user has been provided with at least one access to another user or access profile, that user will see the SWITCH USER PROFILE link in the top navigation bar.\n\nBy following that link, the user will then find all the links to stored accesses that s/he can reach through the ‘switch user’ symbol [[File:Switch.gif‎]].\n\nFor users that occupy more than one role, administrators can provide access to a ‘switch profile’ link on the corresponding home page (/SelfService, /SelfServiceLine, /SelfServiceRecruiter and /SelfServiceBoard). In order for the link to be visible and usable, the user must have appropriate access permissions for the given view (with no visibility restrictions activated).  \n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> Archive (Cannot switch users via PKI) <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"> \n===Cannot switch users via PKI===\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''''PKI not supported as of end 2018''''' \n\n[[File:info.gif]] When authentication via PKI is in place, it is not possible to truly switch users, because the user is identified by means of the browser certificate, and a certificate can only be assigned to one user. \nThis reinforces the security of this approach.\n</div></div>"

You can configure various settings for employee review meetings here, as well as general module access settings.\n__FORCETOC__\n==Settings for employee review meetings==\nIn Employee Management, under ''Settings > Main settings > Modules & Accesses > Settings for employee review meetings'' you can specify the “scope of action” accorded to employees in the employee review meeting process. You also have the option here to define the process individually for each employee. This function is found in the [[Employee file|settings for each employee]]\nYou will find the sections described here under the general settings, each with its own setting options. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] The default settings for the employee review meeting are each labeled “(default setting)”. <br>\n\n[[File:info.gif]] You have the option to use '''import variables''', which have various effects on '''employees’ influence on employee review meetings'''. For more information, see the list of [[Description Employee-Jobs Import|import variables]] (variable names: ''Stelle.MAGProzessKontrolle'' and ''Stelle.MAGAnpassungsEinstellung'').  \n\n===ERM process control by the employee===\nThis menu item lets you give employees a larger or more restricted '''scope of action in the employee review meeting process'''. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] We recommend that you give your employees a reasonable amount of process control, in order to avoid restricting their freedom while also potentially reducing your own administrative effort by getting them actively involved in controlling the process. \n\nYou can configure the following settings:\n* '''Employees can agree on contents and complete assessments.'''\n: Allows employees to take very active control of the process\n* '''Employees can complete assessments.'''\n: Allows employees to take active control of the process\n* '''Employees can agree on contents (''default setting'')'''\n: Allows employees to take limited control of the process\n* '''Employees may NOT approve content nor complete assessments on their own.'''\n: Does not allow employees to take any control over the process\n\n===Modifications made by the employee to content or assessments in the employee review meeting===\nThis menu item lets you give employees a larger or more restricted '''scope of action''' in modifying employee review meeting contents or assessments. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] These settings play an essential role in determining how much an employee can contribute to the employee review meeting process. Restricting employees’ scope of action leads to an enormous increase in administrative effort. If agreed-upon content or completed assessments are modified, a system of notifications gives you full visibility of the actions being taken and the modifications being made. We recommend that you show trust in your employees by letting them take most of the control over the employee review meeting process. Alternatively, if you prefer to protect contents or assessments from fully completed past periods, you can do so in the period settings at any time.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] You will receive a [[System e-mails|system email]] to inform you any time an employee makes a change.\n\nYou can configure the following settings:\n* ''' Employees can modify agreed-upon content and completed assessments as needed. (''default setting'')'''\n: Very wide scope of action for employees\n* '''Employees can modify completed assessments as needed.'''\n: Wide scope of action for employees\n* '''Employees can modify agreed-upon content if needed.'''\n: Restricted scope of action for employees \n* '''Employees may NOT modify agreed-upon content or completed assessments.''' \n: No scope of action for employees\n\n===Visibility of the manager's assessment in the employee view===\nUse this setting to specify when an employee can see their manager’s assessment. Note that you can also specify whether an employee can mark their own employee review meeting as completed. \n\nYou can configure the following settings: \n* '''1. Immediately after the assessment is entered'''\n: The employee can view their manager’s assessment as soon as it has been entered.\n* '''2. Only after explicitly shared by the manager'''\n: The employee can only view the manager’s assessment after it has been [[Employee_review_meeting#Sharing_assessments|shared]].\n* '''3. Only after the employee review meeting is completed (default setting)''' \n: The employee can only view their manager’s assessment after the employee review meeting has been completed.\n* '''3.5 Only after completion of the employee review meeting or after having been explicitly shared'''\n: The employee can only view their manager’s assessment after the employee review meeting has been completed or after explicit release.\n* '''4. Only after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting'''\n: The employee can only view the assessment after the employee review meeting is completed and confirmed.\n* '''4.5 Only after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting or after having been explicitly shared'''\n: The employee can only view the assessment after the employee review meeting is completed and confirmed or after explicit release.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Variants 1 and 2 are best used when the manager’s preparation should be displayed before the meeting, and variants 3 and 4 when this preparation should only be released after the meeting. Between the latter two options, variant 3 is recommended for cases where the employee normally does NOT mark their own employee review meeting as completed, whereas variant 4 is only recommended when confirmation of a completed employee review meeting is the manager’s responsibility rather than the employee’s. Reason for this recommendation: The decision to share an assessment should rest with the person who submitted the assessment, and this makes it necessary to take account of the typical actions in the completion phase for an employee review meeting.\n\n===Visibility of self-assessment in the manager view===\nUse this setting to specify when the self-assessment should become visible in the manager view. \n\nYou can configure the following settings: \n* '''1. Immediately after the assessment is entered''' '''''(default setting)'''''\n: The self-assessment becomes visible in the manager view as soon as it has been entered.\n* '''2.Only after explicitly shared by the employee'''\n: Assessment is visible after it is [[Employee_review_meeting#Sharing_assessments|shared]] by the employee. \n* '''3. Only upon completion of the employee review meeting ''' \n: The self-assessment only becomes visible in the manager view after the employee review meeting has been completed.\n* '''3.5 Only after completion of the employee review meeting or after having been explicitly shared'''\n: The self-assessment only becomes visible in the manager view after the employee review meeting has been completed - or after explicit release.\n* '''4. Only after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting'''\n: Assessment is only visible after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting.\n* '''4.5 Only after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting or after having been explicitly shared'''\n: Assessment is only visible after confirmation of the completed employee review meeting - or after explicit release'.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Variants 1 and 2 are best used when the employee’s preparation should be displayed before the meeting, and variants 3 and 4 when this preparation should only be released after the meeting. Between the latter two options, variant 3 is recommended for cases where the employee normally marks their own employee review meeting as completed, whereas variant 4 is recommended the employee acknowledges the manager's assessment via confirmation. Reason for this recommendation: The decision to share an assessment should rest with the person who submitted the assessment, and this makes it necessary to take account of the typical actions in the completion phase for an employee review meeting.\n\n==Default setting for employee review meeting (ERM) contents==\nHere you can specify which settings should be applied by default when creating a new person in the system. By clicking on the pencil icon [[File:Edit.gif]] next to the headings of each section, you can use the “Yes” and “No” options to turn the individual modules on or off.\n\nFor more detailed information on modules, see [[User roles in the employee management system#Access to modules|Access to modules]].\n\n==Default setting for access to modules==\n[[File:info.gif]] Use the “Data and module access” section to specify which settings should be applied by default for '''new''' managers, HR experts and administrators.\t\n\n====Data and module access====\n'''Access to modules'''<br>\nWhich modules should be selected by default for people who have been newly added to the system (with a basic role other than “Employee” or “External individual”)? The selection made here controls access to the individual modules in the manager view, but it can also be set individually for each person.\n* Goals and tasks (ERM)\n* Personnel development (ERM)\n* Succession planning\n* Events (administrators)\n* Events (users)\n* Analytics (diagrams and Excel reports)\n* Surveys\n* Imports\n* Org chart\n* all salary/bonuses\n* Exports\n* Communication\n* manages networks\n* Employee file\n* Applicant Management\n\n'''Access to salary data'''<br>\nThe selection made here sets the default value for access to salary data. This setting can be configured by an [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|administrator]] separately for each employee with access to the manager view.\n* No access to salary data\n* Access to salary data of direct subordinates only\n* Access to all salary data without immediate supervisor\n* Access to all salary data\n\n==Other settings==\n====Period of access to historized jobs (after they are historized) for managers and other responsible parties====\nAfter a job is historized, managers often still have follow-up work to do for their direct subordinates, such as completing an employee review meeting, recovering any items that were transferred to the employee, or assessing the effectiveness of event participations. In order to avoid exposing sensitive personal information, however, it is important to withdraw former managers’ access to historized jobs, especially for employees who continue to work elsewhere in the company. \n\n* '''Period in days'''\n: Specify the number of days for which access to the historized job should be permitted. \n: [[File:Checkmark.gif]] '''Important notes:'''\n:* The default period is '''90 days''' from the date when the job is historized, after which access is deactivated for the immediate supervisor and other responsible parties. \n:* '''The maximum length''' that can be set for this access period is '''365 days'''. However, any extensions from the default period must be applied before access rights are withdrawn. The period cannot be extended once it has expired. \n:* In special cases, however, the access period can be reset by briefly reactivating a job and then immediately historizing it again. \n:* Access based on membership in a group or organizational unit are not affected.\n\n==Related topics==\n*[[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]\n*[[System e-mails|System emails]]\n*[[Employee review meeting catalogs|Employee review meeting catalogs]]\n*[[User roles in the employee management system|User roles in the Employee Management system]]"

						"__text": "[[Category:Employee management|Employee management]]\n[[Category:Objectives|Objectives]]\n[[de:Ziele]]\nThe \"Goals\" module supports the \"Goal agreement and assessment\" process, and includes various [[Objectives module|functions]]. To get to this tab, you must select an employee from the [[Employee|employee overview]] and then switch to the \"[[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]\" tab. The manager’s goals can be derived from the company objectives, and [[Employee|employees]] can participate in the achievement of their managers’ goals or enter suggestions for additional goals. The goals can be set and the agreed-upon goals can be revised. The goals are assessed at the end of the assessment period.\n\nGoals are agreed upon and assessed for a single planning period (e.g. one year).\n\n==Preparing for the goal agreement==\nIn preparation for the goal agreement, the administrator must create a period in the [[Settings|settings]] and define it as the current period. Company objectives and manager goals can also be created.\n\n==Agreeing on goals==\nIn the employee overview, select the person for whom you wish to enter suggested goals. Once a new goal has been created or copied, the status changes to \"To be agreed on\" (“Being processed”).\n\nEmployees can enter their own suggested goals in the employee view for discussion in the goal agreement meeting. Both employees and managers can mark the goals, tasks etc. that they create as not visible to others. In this way, suggestions can be entered during the preparation phase that are not to be proposed until the meeting.\n\nAfter the employee review meeting, the \"Agree on contents\" action (click on \"Agree\" in the navigation bar on the left) is used to lock the goals and prevent further editing. The employee now has the option to confirm the agreement. The status is modified after each of the steps.\n\n==Weighting goals==\nYou can evaluate the created goals with a fixed value, e.g. from 1 to 3. In this case, a goal with a value of 3 would be weighted more heavily in the assessment than a goal with a value of 1. Your Haufe solution calculates the combined weight of all the goals in the background, so that the weight of each individual goal can be indicated as a percentage of that combined weight.\n\nThe total combined weight is also displayed, along with the weights of the individual goals. The weight of the goal in relation to the total weighting across all areas is also visible as a second percentage value. This value is only displayed if no formula is stored, and the Goals area is one of several [[Calculation formulae|weighted areas]].\n\n==Goal status==\n\nThe possible goal statuses are:\n\n;* To be agreed on (Being processed)\n:This status is set after the creation of new (or newly copied) goals.\n\n;* Agreed on\n:The goals have become part of the current goal agreement. They appear in the goals overview and can be evaluated. The expected level of goal achievement (outlook) can also be set. \n\n;* Closed\n:This status is set after the goal agreement. The goals have been historized and can no longer be evaluated. They appear in the \"Goals\" and \"History\" overviews with a status of \"Completed\".\n\n;* Replaced\n:This status is set for goals that come from an earlier version of the goal agreement that is no longer valid.\n\n==Review and outlook==\nThrough the \"Outlook\" link, you can access a form in which you enter an estimation of goal achievement during the given period. You can fill out this interim estimate as often as you like, and have reminder emails sent to you on these points.\n\n==Assessing goal achievement==\nAt the end of the period, you assess the goals under Actions, using the link for \"Assess performance goals\".\n\nThere you will find a table with all the agreed-upon goals, which you can then select and assess individually. You can do this directly in the table, or by clicking on a goal via [[File:Edit.gif]] and filling out the form.\n\nDuring this period, you can have regular emails sent to employees, reminding them to evaluate whether and to what extent they expect to achieve their goals. \n\nExpected goal achievement:\n{|\n|-\n|Achieved||dark green [[File:Dot_darkgreen.gif]]\n|- \n|Likely||bright green [[File:Dot_brightgreen.gif‎]]\n|-\n|Questionable||yellow [[File:Dot_yellow.gif]] \n|-\n|Unlikely||red [[File:Dot_red.gif]] \n|-\n|No response||nothing\n|}\n\n==Excluding a goal from the assessment==\n\nWhen assessing individual goals, if you would like to set a goal aside as not currently assessable so that it is not included in the calculation, then either leave out the assessment for this goal, or create a value in the assessment list such as \"not assessable\" to which NO weight is assigned (not even 0). In either case, the goal will then be left out of the calculation of the average. Goals that have been weighted at 0 in the agreement from the very beginning will also be left out of the calculation. \"Tasks\", \"Competencies\" etc. behave the same way.\n\n==Creating company and departmental objectives==\nUsers with the CEO or Admin roles can create company objectives for a selected period.\nThey can specify which company objectives should be displayed to employees. Like employee goals, company objectives can be assessed according to their likelihood of being achieved, and can also be marked as completed. \n\nAnother level of goals between company objectives and manager goals are departmental objectives. Organizational units are assigned to which the departmental objectives then apply. Departmental objectives can be created by all internal roles with access to the Goals module, in accordance with organizational units’ access rights. They are visible for everyone in the assigned organizational unit, and in all subordinate organizational units. If multiple blocks of departmental goals exist for each organizational unit, all goals are displayed to employees.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Important''': The department goals are on the position as soon as the content is agreed (status \"agreed\" is set). If the person now changes the org unit/matrix org unit without changing the occupation, the goals of the previous org unit are still displayed.\n\n==Indicator-based calculation of goal achievement==\nGoal achievement can be calculated based on indicators in all subareas of the employee review meeting. To do this, a starting value for the indicator, a target value, and the actually achieved value are specified in absolute numbers. In this way, relevant quantitative values can be used to measure goal achievement – e.g. for departmental objectives.\n* The starting value is an initial value for the indicator — for example, revenues of CHF 100,000. \n* The target value is the value that we are trying to achieve, e.g. revenues of CHF 120,000. \n* The actually achieved value is the indicator value that was actually reached, e.g. revenues of CHF 126,000. \n\nWhen the actual value achieved is entered in absolute numbers in the appropriate field at the end of the period (or for the assessment), the system automatically calculates the degree of goal achievement as a percentage. In the above example, goal achievement is 130%, since the expected revenue increase was CHF 20,000 but the company actually achieved CHF 26,000 (= 130%).\n\n===Individual goal achievement – example calculation formula (no calculation of percentage)===\n[[File:info.gif]] The following calculation formula for an “individual goal achievement” does not calculate a percentage value below the starting indicator (unlike the default setting): \n my $achievement_range = <ItemTargetValue> - <ItemStartValue>;\n my $achieved_relative = <ItemAchievedValue> - <ItemStartValue>;\n my $achievement = '';\n \n if ( $achievement_range == 0 ) {\n            if ( $achieved_value = <ItemTargetValue> ) {\n                        $achievement = 100;\n            }\n            else {\n                        $achievement = 0;\n            }\n }\n else {\n            if ( <ItemAchievedValue> < <ItemStartValue> ) {\n                        $achievement = 0;\n            }\n            else {\n                        $achievement = (( 100 / (<ItemTargetValue> - <ItemStartValue>) ) * $achieved_relative);\n            }\n }\n \n $achievement;\n\n==[[File:Schloss_16.png]] Who sees what?==\n;* Goal agreement\n:Both employees and managers can suggest goals, and can see the other party’s suggestions. Employees also see their manager’s agreed-upon goals.\n\n;* Assessment\n:In order for employees to see the assessment, you can activate the display of achievement level and any comments on company or departmental objectives as a column in the list of company objectives. \n\nAs an administrator, you can specify in the settings whether all employees are allowed to see the company objectives.\n\n==How does communication happen?==\nThe following explains the steps that are followed for an email communication.\n\n[[File:Ziele Prozess Kommunikation.png]]\n\n==Process control==\nAs an HR expert, you start the goal agreement process at the beginning of the period by writing an email either to all employees or only to the managers. Use the search function to find all the people to whom you wish to send the email. Select \"all\" underneath the search in order to select the people found by the search. Using the selection field, select one of the communication options and click \"Apply\".\n\nYou can also use the email notification to request interim and final assessments.\n\nTo check the process status, use the search mentioned above and remind people individually by email of what they need to do."

Please note that only version \"[http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/business-of-scorm/scorm-versions/ SCORM 1.2 (en)]\" is fully supported by Haufe.\n\n[[File:Attention.gif]] '''Notes:'''\n* The ZIP file may not be larger than 1000 MB.\n* You can use the following file (WBT in SCORM 1.2 format) for testing purposes: [https://de.onlinehelp.umantis.com/index.php/File:DemoSurfing_SCORM.zip DemoSurfing_SCORM.zip]\n* Please note that the IDs of a course (''long_identifier_type'') must not contain any spaces, otherwise a proper functionality cannot be ensured. \n* The imsmanifest.xml file must be in the immediate root of the content package (.ZIP file), not inside another folder within the package.\n* The content of the ''imsmanifest.xml'' should generally not be a one-liner, otherwise this can lead to problems when running a scorm course.\n* When creating '''ZIP files''' on '''Windows systems''', note the following as well (only when using the Windows ZIP program):\n: Do '''not''' use subfolder structures if the subfolder stands '''alone''', because files within this subfolder will not be correctly accessible.\n: For example, the following folder structure would result in a course that does '''not''' work correctly:\n:* scorm_course_XY\n::* course &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''# Contains the start HTML file for the course, which has to access files in “/shared_files/scripts”, for example''\n::* shared_files &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''# Contains a “scripts” subfolder''\n:::*\tscripts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''# Contains the files used by the start HTML file (see above)''\n: The “scripts” subfolder stands alone as the only item in the “shared_files” folder, which can lead to problems with courses zipped in Windows.<br>  \n:'''Therefore, use the following structure:''' \n:* '''scorm_course_XY'''\n::* '''course''' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''# Contains the start HTML file for the course, which has to access files in “/shared_files”, for example''\n::* ''' shared_files''' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '' # Contains the files used by the start HTML file (see above)''\n\n[[File:info.gif]] You can configure the settings for the online course in the relevant section within the [[Event details#Online course|event details]].\n<br>\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] Please make sure to add a button or similar mechanism that completes the SCORM-course to ensure that the status handling can work correctly.\n\n==Use an online course==\nIn order to be able to use the online course for an event, the participant must be registered for the event. As soon as this is done, an \"Online course\" block appears on the left side, with the following actions:\n* [[File:Action.gif]] Start course: Use this to start the web-based training. When the training starts, a status appears to indicate that the online course is ongoing.\n* [[File:Notok.gif]] Cancel ongoing online course: The online course is terminated. Any unsaved progress in the ongoing online course will be lost. This link is only visible if the online course has not been correctly terminated by the user.\n* [[File:Action.gif]] Confirm successful completion of the course: In the form that appears, you can confirm the successful completion of the course and enter a comment. After saving, you will see the confirmation in the event.\n\nThe information saved includes the progress made (as a percentage), the number of minutes spent in the training, and a status indicating whether the participant went through the entire course.\n\n==Values and descriptions for the status of an online course==\n\n'''The following values provide information about the status of an online course:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| English value\n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| German value\n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| Description\n|-\n|Passed \n|Passed \n| The required number of objectives in the SCO were mastered, or the required score was achieved. \nStudent is considered to have completed the SCO and passed.\n|-\n|Completed \n|Completed\n| The SCO may or may not be passed, but all the elements in the SCO were experienced by the student. <br>\nThe student is considered to have completed the SCO. For instance, passing may depend on a certain score <br>\nknown to the LMS system. The SCO knows the raw score, but not whether that raw score was high enough to pass. \n|-\n|Failed \n|Not passed\n| The SCO was not passed. The student may or may not have completed all the SCO elements. \nThe student is considered to have completed the SCO and failed.\n|-\n|Incomplete \n|Incomplete\n| The SCO was begun but not finished. \n|-\n|Browsed \n|Viewed\n| The student launched the SCO with an LMS mode of Browse on the initial attempt. \n|-\n|Not attempted \n|Not started\n| \"Incomplete\" implies that the student made an attempt to perform the SCO, but for some reason was unable to <br>\nfinish it. \"Not attempted\" means that the student did not even begin the SCO. Maybe he just read the table of <br>\ncontents or SCO abstract, and decided he was not ready. Any algorithm within the SCO may be used to determine <br>\nwhen the SCO moves from \"Not attempted\" to \"Incomplete\".\n|}\n\n==Technical description of the SCORM API==\n\n'''The following data are received by Haufe through the API:'''\n* Data Content (complete data for all fields delivered by the API)\n* Time (cmi.core.total_time)\n* Points: Score in % if MaxScore has been specified, otherwise just ScoreRaw ( cmi.core.score.raw, cmi.core.score.max )\n* Status (cmi.core.lesson_status)\n\n'''The following data are sent to the API from Haufe when loading:'''\n* Data Content\n* cmi.core.student_id ( PersonId )\n* cmi.core.student_name ( EntityIdentifier )\n* cmi.core.lesson_status ( online course status )\n* cmi.core.total_time ( total time for online course )\n\n'''Tips for students on working with SCORM'''\n* 1. Only browser versions which are supported by the online course should be used. In some cases, browser plugins must also be installed (e.g. Adobe Flash).\n* 2. The browser window for the online course should only be closed by the mechanism intended for that purpose.\n* 3. If a user starts an online course and then leaves their workstation for too long a time, the session will expire. When the user returns to their workstation to continue with the course, they can continue to work on the course in the open course window, but the state of the course will not be communicated correctly to Haufe."

This type of visualization is especially useful for [[Succession planning|succession planning]]. It allows each manager to quickly see where action is needed within their own organization, and what’s going on with planning for successors.  \nThe org charts are operated as a separate module, and are activated by our support staff as part of the setup process. \n\nPlease contact us if you are interested in being able to provide a visual representation of your company’s structure.\n\n==System requirements==\nThe real-time org chart can be used in Internet Explorer 8, Chrome, Firefox and Safari. JavaScript must be activated in order to use the real-time org chart.\nThe org chart can be displayed in both the manager view (internal view) and in the employee view.\n\n'''Important:''' \n* Internet Explorer 7 and older versions are not supported! Check your active document mode in IE by pressing F12, and change it if necessary to test compatibility.\n\n==Permissions concept==\nFor displays with sensitive data like those found e.g. in the manager view (My Employees / My Employees via Organization), the way that data is displayed in the org chart is based on the Haufe permissions concept. This means that everything you can see in Haufe, and all data you have access to under the permissions concept, is presented in the organigram in exactly the same way. You see it there in a nice, graphic style.\n\nFor example, if a manager has no access to succession planning, then they will not see any icons in the boxes for succession planning. Similarly, all successors are hidden in the org chart, so that only “simple” boxes are displayed.\n\nThere are no permissions behind the views in /SelfService. The only org charts visible there are those to which all employees have access, with no sensitive data.\n\nNote that the org chart is aperiodic, and that any changes you make are therefore immediately visible in the org chart. The org chart therefore always corresponds to the latest state of the data.\n\nImportant to know:\n\nIn the manager view, you cannot see any sensitive data about yourself. Therefore, you cannot see the link to your own succession planning. Clicking on the profile icon and the performance graph will take you to your SelfService view. Your performance graph will appear blank in that view. “Risk of leaving” is neutral. Display of possible successors in your own entry in the org chart is also suppressed.\n\n==Versions==\n\n===Org chart version 3===\nSince version 2 of the org chart, you can choose to display staff positions and [[Vacancies|vacant posts]] while hiding sensitive data with the “Management Circle” function. \nVersion 3 of the org chart also includes various performance improvements.<br>\n[[File:info.gif]] If you are using a customized org chart, individual modifications may be necessary. Consult with your Haufe contact for more information. \n\nIf you are using a “default” org chart:\n* To activate the new version of the org chart, go to ''Settings > Main settings > Set up org chart'' tab ''> Custom templates for org chart'', then enter '''orgmanager_v3''' under “Name”. <br>[[File:attention.gif]] Customized templates/org charts can be modified separately through our [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com Customer Service].\n\nWe recommend that you always activate the latest version of the org chart so that you can always take advantage of all the newest functions (and bug fixes).\n\n===Org chart version 17_2===\nAlongside further performance improvements, org chart version 17_2 contains the following additional features: \n* You can see employees’ birthdays under “''My employees''” and “''My employees via organization''”. \n* Under “''All employees''” and “''All employees via organization''”, a tool tip shows you which employees are currently present. (Corresponds to the ''Presence'' value in the master data.)\n\nNote that only information that is stored in the system can be displayed.  \n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you are using a customized org chart, individual modifications may be necessary. Consult with your Haufe contact for more information. \n\nIf you are using a “default” org chart:\n* To activate the new version of the org chart, go to ''Settings > Main settings > Set up org chart'' tab ''> Custom templates for org chart'', then enter '''orgmanager_v17_2''' under “Name”. <br>[[File:attention.gif]] Customized templates/org charts can be modified separately through our [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com Customer Service].\n\n===Org chart version 18_2===\nAlongside further performance improvements, org chart version 18_2 contains the following additional features:\n* Instead of five views, there are now three: the “Employees via organization” and “All employees via organization” views are no longer displayed. On the other hand, the hierarchy tree has been extended for the “My employees” and “All employees” perspectives, and can now be switched over without changing perspectives. Switch the hierarchy tree by clicking on your preferred hierarchy variant (position hierarchy or organizational hierarchy). Your chosen selection is then displayed in the org chart.     \n* Employees who are assigned to two organizational units are also shown in the chart views for both organizational units. \n* In the “My employees” and \"All employees\" views, a search function is included in the org chart area to help you find specific employees quickly and easily.  \n* When you mouse over a successor, a successor tooltip appears with all the information fields from the job holder’s tooltip (including Performance and Risk).\n* In the ''SelfService'' view, the employees are shown in the org chart when “Organization” is selected as the view option.\nNote that only information that is stored in the system can be displayed.  \n\n[[File:info.gif]] If you are using a customized org chart, individual modifications may be necessary. Consult with your Haufe contact for more information. \n\nIf you are using a “default” org chart:\n* To activate the new version of the organigram, go to ''Settings > Main settings > Set up organigram'' tab ''> Custom templates for organigram'', then enter '''orgmanager_v18_2''' under “Name”. <br>[[File:attention.gif]] Customized templates/org charts can be modified separately through our [mailto:htm-support@haufe.com Customer Service].\n\n==Views==\n\n====Views in manager view:====\n=====My Employees:=====\n* Shows the employees with successors by job hierarchy / organizational units<br>\n* A permissions concept underlies this view. Each employee sees only what they are allowed to see. For example, this means that HR experts or the administrator cannot see the data for the employees above them in the hierarchy.\n* The risk of leaving is also visible as a colored bar to the left of the employee photo:\n* Gray: Normal\n* Green: Low\n* Orange: High\n* Red: Very high\n* Also displayed: Performance matrix, Key position\n* The tool tip contains sensitive data like Performance, Risk of leaving, and Potential. \n* Sensitive data like Performance, Risk, Potential and Successors for the currently logged-in user are not shown. The link that would normally lead to the successors points to the home page instead.\n* Icon bar with links to succession planning and the employee profile\n* When you mouse over a successor, a successor tooltip appears with all the information fields from the job holder’s tooltip (except for “Performance” and “Risk”). \n\n===== All employees:=====\n* Shows all employees in the company with successors by job hierarchy / organizational units\n* No permissions concept is used here; all employees are visible, like in a telephone book\n* Risk of leaving, Key position, Performance matrix and Potential are not visible.\n\n=====Organization=====\n* Shows the company structure by organizational units\n\n* OU number and OU name are displayed\n\n* No tool tip \n\n* No permissions concept; organizational units are visible for all users\n\n====Display in employee view:====\n\nEmployees can view the org chart under “Company” – “Org chart”. If the link is not displayed, then the administrator will need to make it visible.\nSince all employees in the company have access to the org chart, only views that do not contain sensitive data are made available.  Here, too, you can select which views you want to see. \n\n* All employees (similar to the view in the manager view)\n* Organization (similar to the view in the manager view)\n\nThe external views are configured similarly to the internal views. In the employee view, there is no ruler in the “Organization” view. Employees are shown directly under the OU.\n\n====Display of org chart for external individuals (/MyPublic)====\n\nThe option to display people in the org chart can be [[Configuration mode|activated]] for [[People directory|External individuals]] (<nowiki>https://employeeapp-CUSTOMERID.umantis.com/MyPublic</nowiki>). In cases of [[Access as an external person|access as an external person]], the person can be displayed in the org chart by clicking on the “Show in org chart” link under Actions, once display of that link has been activated.\n\n==Ruler==\n\nThe org chart’s display configuration is known as the “ruler”. The ruler is displayed in both views, but with different selection options.\n\n====Ruler in Manager view====\n\nManagers can select various options to display specific information in the org chart:\n\n* '''Display diagram:''' You can place individual employees in the diagram via drag & drop, and compare performance, risk of leaving and potential. At the top edge of the diagram, you also have the option to toggle the display of the diagram.\n* '''Highlight key positions:''' These positions are marked with a small key symbol. With the ruler, you have the option to highlight [[Job profile (employee management)|key positions]] a bit more strongly. \n* '''Gray out normal positions:''' This function shows normal positions in gray, making specially-marked positions easier to see.\n*'''Hide [[Staff positions|staff positions]]:''' Checking the box hides so-called [[Staff positions|staff positions]]. (only in Org chart version 2)\n* '''Show [[Vacancies|vacant posts]]:''' This function marks jobs that are currently vacant. (Note: Only in Org chart version 2. Vacant posts do not work with the SAP interface!)\n* '''Display diagram:''' This function displays a small window. You can drag and drop people into this window in order to compare them to one another in terms of Performance / Potential / Risk.\n* '''Management Circle:''' With this function, you can hide all sensitive data for your direct subordinates with a single click.\n\n\nIn the “Organization” view, there is a small ruler that you can use to make the employees that belong to the organizational unit (OU) appear under the OU. Two icons are also displayed in the box at the top that show you the number of employees in the OU and the number of vacant posts in the organizational unit.\n\n====Ruler in employee view====\n\nIn the employee view, we can check the box to display the 3rd level at a smaller size and with less information. This way, you always have an overview.\n\n==4x5 Performance Matrix==\n[[File:info.gif]] You can see a person’s performance and potential in the org chart by using the 4x5 Performance Matrix. The way in which this matrix is displayed depends on the overall assessment (performance) and potential. This allows you to quickly see which people have high potential/good performance, and which have room for improvement. \n\nTo ensure that the Performance-Potential Matrix is displayed correctly, the following values should be set in the appropriate [[Selection lists|selection list]] for the org chart: \n\n'''Selection list: “Development potential” (PotentialWeight):'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| \n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| Achievement level\n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| Weight\n|-\n|[[File:HohesPotential.gif]] \n|High potential\n|120\n|-\n|[[File:PotentialVorhanden.gif]] \n|Potential exists\n|90\n|-\n|[[File:AmRichtigenOrt.gif]] \n|In the right place\n|30\n|-\n|[[File:Ueberfordert.gif]] \n|Overburdened\n|10\n|}  \n\n'''Selection list: “Achievement level – Overall assessment” (PerformanceWeight):'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| Achievement level\n! style=\"color:darkgreen;background-color:silver;\"| Weight\n|-\n|AAA – outstanding\n|120\n|-\n|AA – very good\n|100\n|-\n|A – good\n|80\n|-\n|B – room for improvement\n|50\n|-\n|C – falls short of expectations\n|10\n|}\n\n\nAs a function of the [[Potential#Employee's Performance Potential Matrix|employee’s Performance-Potential Matrix]], the following views (for example) can be displayed in the org chart:\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|[[File:Performance_AA_Potential_hoch.png|border|200px]]\n|Person/Employee was assessed as '''AA – very good''' in the overall assessment (Performance) \nand evaluated under Potential as having '''High potential'''\n|-\n|[[File:Performance_C_Potential_ueberfordert.png|border|200px]]\n|Person/Employee was assessed as '''C – falls short of expectations''' in the overall assessment (Performance) \nand evaluated under Potential as being '''Overburdened'''\n|-\n|[[File:Performance_ohne_Potential.png|border|200px]]\n|If the entry for a given dimension is '''missing''', the entire row or column will be highlighted in color in the 4x5 Performance Matrix. \nIn this example, '''the entry for the Potential dimension is missing''' (employee’s potential has not yet been assessed by the manager, or the “Development potential” [[Selection lists|selection list]] contains no weighting or the wrong weighting).\n|-\n|[[File:Potential_ohne_Performance.png|border|200px]]\n|If the entry for a given dimension is '''missing''', the entire row or column will be highlighted in color in the 4x5 Performance Matrix. \nIn this example, '''the entry for the Performance dimension is missing''' (manager has not yet performed an overall assessment for this employee, or the “Achievement level – Overall assessment” [[Selection lists|selection list]] contains no weighting or the wrong weighting).\n|}\n\n<br>\n\n==Icon bar in the org chart boxes==\n\nThe boxes in the employee view include an icon bar with links to the associated employee profile and the associated succession planning. If there are no successors yet for a given job, the link leads to the page to create a new succession plan. A successor can then be directly assigned here.\n\n\n==Updating the org chart==\n\nWhen the browser window is updated by pressing F5 (Reload), the entire org chart is reloaded and the latest data from Haufe are displayed.\n\nWith the “Refresh” button, you can update precisely the view that you are currently looking at. The navigation menu is also reloaded, and shows the appropriate navigation menu for the view after reloading.\n\n==Multiple language support==\nThe org chart supports all Haufe languages. For the Haufe default org chart, the user interface is already translated. This applies to view selection, the ruler, level selection, and the tool tips in the org chart interface.\n\nIf you have a customized org chart with your own entries, you must modify the texts in your solution. \n\n\nYou can do this yourself quite easily through the “fixed lists” area.\nFor each language, proceed as follows:<br>\n\n1.\tSettings -> Selection lists -> Fixed lists<br>\n2.\tOnce there, find “ReportLabels” (case-sensitive)<br>\n3.\tWhen the ReportLabels appear, click on “Modify” to the right<br>\n4.\tA long list with about 150 entries will appear; advance to the last page in the list<br>\n5.\tYou will now see the entries from the org chart, e.g. “View selection”<br>\n6.\tTo modify an entry, go to “Modify” to the right of the label and change the text to contain your desired text<br>\n7.\tSave and review the changes in the org chart<br>\n\n==Print in the org chart==\n\nTo allow you to print out your org chart, we have integrated a small print icon in the org chart navigation area. Click on it to select whether you want to open the PDF right away, or save it.\n\n==Tips and tricks==\n\n* To ensure that the performance graph is correctly displayed, the weighting must be entered correctly in [[Selection lists|selection lists]] 17 and 60.\n* If you are having display problems, be sure to check your browser version as well. In Internet Explorer, there is also a “document mode” that can be set up to differ from the current browser version. Please check with your IT department on this point. Take note of the tips on [[Tips and tricks#Turn off Compatibility View|Compatibility View]] as well\n* If you do not yet have any [[Succession planning|succession planning]] in place, then the successors will not be shown in the org chart.\n* The performance graph always shows the current period.\n* If you have no employee photos in Haufe, a placeholder is shown.\n* If the performance data are not filled out in your solution, a placeholder image will be shown for the performance graph.\n* If printing doesn’t work, add the print URL to the trustworthy pages."

Typical examples of organizational units include jobs and departments, but entire divisions or individual branch offices can also be viewed as organizational units. Organizational units are the traditional basic elements of a formal organization (established by official rules). Important tools for representing these structures include org charts, job descriptions and function diagrams. (Source: [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisationseinheit Wikipedia])\n\n==Organizational units and events==\nEvent administrators with access to the organizational units selected under this menu item will also have access to this event. \nBy default, subordinate organizational units are not included. For example: Event is released for organizational unit A. \nAn employee with access to organizational unit AA, but not to A, cannot administer this event.\nNote that this setting has no effect on how the published event is displayed in the event catalog. \nThis means that employees will always see all events in the Self Service (or Public) view. By searching on “Events for my organizational unit”, an employee can restrict the events shown in the event catalog to the ones from their “department”.\n\n=Matrix organizational unit=\n\nA matrix organizational unit is an organizational unit within a matrix structure ([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrixorganisation Matrix management]). <br>\nA matrix organization is one possible structural principle that can be used to organize responsibilities within a company. In this structure, management functions are distributed over two equal and independent dimensions (e.g. functional and product dimensions). Employees are subject to two equally-weighted management hierarchies, e.g. they report to managers in general functional departments like procurement, production and sales, and also to managers for specific products. As such, a matrix organization is a form of [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linienorganisation#Mehrliniensystem multidimensional organization].

You also have the option here to assess the employee across all areas.\nThe contents of the employee review meeting include, e.g.: [[Objectives|Goals]], [[Job tasks |tasks]], [[Competencies|competencies]] and [[Development objectives|development goals]], [[Behavioural criteria|behavioral criteria]] and [[Feedback topics|feedback topics]]. Once the contents of the employee review meeting have been established, they can then be individually assessed. \n\nYou can also proceed separately with individual subareas by separating them from the employee review meeting as a whole. The settings for this are configured in the appropriate [[Planning periods|period settings]].\n\n* '''Modification history'''\n: A modification history is included in the employee review meeting. This means that all basic/relevant changes are saved, and can be reviewed in the history. This makes it easier to keep track of changes (by authorized people) to the description or weighting of a goal, for example. Please note that the history of content is no longer accessible after the content is deleted. The history includes the following information about each change: \n:* User who made the change\n:* Date/time of change\n:* Subarea that was modified\n:* Old value/New value\n:* Deleted documents (see “Uploading documents” below)\n\n* '''Uploading documents'''\n:* In the overall assessment for an employee, you have the option to upload a document that explains/justifies your overall assessment (for example).

Select a planning period and click on [[File:Edit.GIF]] to enter the settings.  \n\n===General===\n* '''Period name'''\n: The name is linked to allow switching periods, and displayed everywhere (monolingually). (Ex.: 2017)\t\n* '''Historized'''\n:Periods that are marked as completed are removed from the current period selection list / Period can no longer be selected in the various actions.\n\n===Third-party assessment – Employee review meeting (ERM)===\n\nThe following settings relate to [[Third-party evaluation|third-party assessments]] (also: ''Evaluation by a third party'').\n\n'''Important notes:'''\n* Always set the period setting '''first''' so that you can then start the round of employee review meetings or third-party assessments. To avoid undesirable and/or erroneous behavior, avoid making changes later on to the period settings for periods that are already active.\n* Note that a few setting options depend on a correctly configured [[Selection lists|selection list]]. For example, the settings below relating to the “discarded result” require a meaningfully defined [[Objectives#Weighting goals|weighting]] for the selection list value for each subarea in the [[Employee review meeting|employee review meeting]].\n* Please note that when anonymous third-party assessments are used, the person being assessed sees no information about the status of the given third-party assessment, and thus cannot send reminders to the third-party assessor.\n* Certain '''possible actions in the employee review meeting process''' are dependent on the settings defined below (e.g. the actions to “'''''Create/modify list of third-party assessors for anonymous assessment'''''” and “'''''Start anonymous third-party assessment round and send invitations'''''”.\n* ...\n\n'''Tip:''' [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|30px]] The following setting options, marked with a star, can increase the quality of third-party assessments when used properly. \n----\n\n===Setting options===\n====Composition of proposed list of third-party assessors====\nYou can specify here which people should automatically appear in the list of proposed names for invitation to a third-party assessment. \nThe following values are included in the fixed list ''ThirdPartySuggest'':\n* Manager for the position\n* Manager of the manager for the position\n* Other supervisors\n* Employees from the same organizational unit\n* Manager’s direct reports\n* Third-party assessors invited in earlier periods\n\n[[File:info.gif]]  If you do not make any selection, all the displayed values will automatically be suggested, and the displayed list will be updated in the next “round” with third-party assessors from the most recently sent invitations.\n\n[[File:attention.gif]] A change in the composition of the list of proposed assessors may not take effect for the given employee until after a delay of up to 15 minutes. If desired, add the URL extension ''?clearCache=true'' to shorten this delay.\n\n====Contents not individually selectable for subareas====\nCheck the boxes for individual subareas of the employee review meeting. Using “Forward to third parties” will then always forward '''all content''' of those subareas for assessment by the third-party assessor. In this case, selection is not possible at the time the invitation is sent.\n\n====Anonymous assessment for subareas====\nCheck the boxes for subareas of the employee review meeting that should receive '''anonymous assessments only'''. \n\n====Minimum number of anonymous third-party assessors for subareas [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|20px]]====\nSpecify how many third-party assessors must be invited before the third-party assessment round is opened for each area. By default, at least '''three''' people are required (i.e. at least three people must be invited to the third-party assessment before the third-party assessment process can be used). \n\n====Assess within [days]====\nDefault setting if “Assess by” is not explicitly set by the person sending the invitation. If you do not enter a value for this setting, then a value of 4 weeks (28 days) is used. This value is overwritten if the “Assess by” field is displayed in the form and set to a specific value by the person sending the invitation. If the specified value is larger than 90, it also raises the limit of 90 days that serves as the maximum assessment period.\n\n====Average of third-party assessments as manager assessment for subareas====\nCheck the boxes for subareas of the employee review meeting for which the '''third-party assessment''' should be handled the same way as a manager assessment (main assessment). In this case, the average of all third-party assessments for each content item (goal, task etc.) automatically counts as an '''authoritative assessment''' and is therefore considered as the '''deciding assessment''' (relative to other assessments). \n: [[File:info.gif]] This assessment is displayed in the system as the “Manager assessment”. When using this function, we recommend that you set the relevant field (''Manager assessment'' or ''Assessment by manager'') to “[[Configuration mode#Configure form|display]]” in order to protect it.\n\n====Minimum number of third-party assessments to allow average to be displayed for non-anonymous assessment [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|20px]]====\nTo ensure that third-party assessments are only displayed when they are of sufficient quality for the person being assessed, a threshold value can be very useful. Once the specified number of third-party assessments has been reached, the average value is displayed. If there are discarded values, they are nevertheless counted as well. \n\n====Minimum number of third-party assessments to allow average to be displayed for anonymous assessment [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|20px]]====\nSame effect as for the previous setting, but for anonymous assessments.\n\n====Minimum number of assessments to trigger discarded result for non-anonymous assessment [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|20px]]====\nEnter a number of assessments above which the worst and the best assessment will be discarded, i.e. not included in the calculation (cf. [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streichergebnis Discarded result]). These two assessments are shown grayed out.\n: '''Example:''' You enter an '''8''' here. After 8 (or more) third-party assessments have been received, the worst and the best assessment will not be included in the calculation of the average value. In this case, if 7 third-party assessments are received, nothing happens, i.e. no assessments are “discarded” when calculating the average value. \n: '''Background:''' Every third-party assessment that is submitted can in principle contribute to the calculation of an average value for all third-party assessments. When at least the number of assessments specified above has been reached for each content item (goal, task etc.), the best and the worst third-party assessment will not be used in determining the average value. This reduces the impact of extreme assessments by individual people. If fewer responses are received, then no result is discarded, in order to avoid situations where there are too few third-party assessments and therefore no average and no result. Be sure to also pay attention here to the setting for the minimum number of third-party assessments that must be received for an average to be calculated. Also note that discarded results are only possible if at least 3 assessments are received. \n\n====Discarded result from number of assessments with anonymous assessment [[File:Favouriteicon.PNG|20px]]====\nSame effect as for the previous setting, but for anonymous assessments. \n\n----\n\n===Overall assessment – Employee review meeting (ERM)===\n* '''Components:'''\n:*[[Objectives|Goals]]\n:*[[Tasks / job tasks|Tasks]]\n:*[[Competencies|Competencies]]\n:*[[Development objectives|Development goals]]\n:*[[Behavioural criteria|Behavioral criteria]]\n:*[[Feedback subjects|Feedback topics]]\n:[[File:info.gif]] An empty field means: All parts are included. If only certain parts are not selected, then these will not be affected by actions (e.g. Agree) in the “Overall assessment” area. Therefore, the default calculation of the overall assessment will also exclude these areas, independently of their weight in the calculation formula. Formulas are not affected by this setting.\n\n* '''Automatic assessment of subareas'''\t\n: If you check this box, the assessment of the subareas will be calculated automatically once the individual content items (e.g. goals) have each been assessed. The overall assessment across all areas is not affected.\n\n* '''Automatic overall assessment'''\n:If you check this box, the overall assessment will be calculated automatically once the content items (e.g. goals) have been assessed individually or all together. Note that the calculation of the overall assessment may depend on the values from the assessment of the subareas. In this case, you should also check the box for “Automatic assessment of subareas”.\n\n* '''Close period for changes to employee review meeting contents:'''\n:If you check this box, then no one can make changes anymore to the contents of employee review meetings for this period. \n\n* '''Close period for changes to assessments:''' \n:If you check this box, then no one can make changes anymore to the assessments in employee review meetings for this period.\n:'''Note:''' This setting also stops changes to the contents of employee review meetings.\n\n===Salary & bonus calculation===\n* '''Release for “Salary & bonus” round access level:'''\n:* Level 1\n:* Level 2\n:* Level 3\n:[[File:info.gif]] An empty value for this field means that anyone with access to the Salary & Bonus module has access, and can modify salary increase and bonus information for their employees. If you select a specific level here, then only people with that access level are able to modify salary information. A person’s access level is assigned in the settings in their [[Employee file|employee file]]. Administrators always have access, regardless of their access level.\n\n* '''Notes'''\n: Free text field\n\n* '''Close period for Salary and Bonus'''\n: If you check this box, then no one can make changes anymore to salary and bonus information for this period.\n\n==Related topics==\n* [[Planning periods|Planning periods]]\n* [[Create new period|Create new period]]\n* [[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]"

In employee management, potential is determined with the help of a scale.\n\nYou can enter an employee's potential in the Employee Review tab (‘''Employee > Employee Directory > Select Employee > Employee Review > Potential’'') \n\n==Assess potential==\n===Employee's potential — Manager's assessment===\n[[File:info.gif]] To assess the employee's potential, first select the year the potential should be assessed for. \n\n* Click on [[File:edit.GIF]]\n* Rate the employee's development potential e.g. by selecting one of the following selection values:\n: O  High potential\n: O  Some potential\n: O  At the right position\n: O  Overburdened\n\n* Select the department and, where applicable, the relevant managerial responsibility and position(s). Information on the risk of leaving can also be entered.\n\nIf a potential has been selected for the employee, the [[Potential#Employee's Performance Potential Matrix|Employee Performance Potential Matrix]] will appear. This shows the employee's overall performance, i.e. their overall assessment, alongside your own estimation of the employee’s potential.\n\nAlong with the other actions, you also have the possibility of copying over the potential assessment of the previous year.\n\nEmployees have the option to estimate their own potential under \"Self-evaluation\".\n\n[[File:info.gif]] '''Note:''' The currently valid and saved assessments of an employee’s potential are displayed under their “Career progression”, in the “Potential and risks” section — provided it is [[Configuration mode|enabled for display]].\n\n===Change log for Potential===\n[[File:History.png]] Modification history<br>\nA history of the modifications that have been made in an employee's “Potential” area can be viewed here.

Just as their manager or HR expert does, the employee can evaluate their own development potential (for example) by clicking on [[File:edit.GIF]] and selecting one of the following values: \n: O  High potential\n: O  Potential \n: O  Current position is optimal\n: O  Overburdened — I need support\n\n===Employee's Performance Potential Matrix===\nAn employee's Performance Potential Matrix provides a quick insight of performances and potential that is visually displayed with a chart.

It is a mandatory field that must be shown and filled in so that linked actions remain functional (e.g. copying sub-areas).\n\n===Copy contents from previous period===\nThis combined (multiple) action allows you to copy over contents from the previous period\n\n# Search for and select employees\n# Multiple action: “Copy contents from previous period”\n:...note the following comments and configuration options. \n\n''Are you sure you want to copy the contents from the previous period to the employee review meetings for the selected period for the jobs selected earlier? Existing contents will be kept; the contents from the previous period will simply be added to them.'' \n\n* '''Period*:'''\n: The previous period is calculated relative to the period selected here.\n\n* '''Select section:'''\t\n**Goals\n**Tasks\n**Competencies\n**Development goals\n**Behavioral criteria\n**Feedback\n:Select the sections that should be copied over. If you do not select a section, then all active sections of the entire employee review meeting will be copied.\n\n* '''Force addition'''\n: If you check this box, existing agreements will be reopened and the contents will be added.\n* '''Suppress email notification'''\n: If existing notifications need to be reopened, then no notifications will be sent to the participants in the employee review meeting.\n* '''Delete other contents'''\n: If you check this box, then all existing contents from the given section will be deleted.\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Note that contents can only be copied from the previous period once, in order to avoid duplications and overwriting of contents.\n\n===Assign calculation formula===\nProcess for “Copy calculation formula”: \n# Search for and select employees\n# Multiple action “Copy calculation formula”\n# Select [[Calculation formulae|calculation formula]]\n# Select period and decide whether existing agreements should also be taken into account when adding\nResult: The selected calculation formula is copied over for period X.\n\n===Agree on contents===\nProcess for “Agree”: \n\n# Search for and select employees \n# Multiple action “Agree on contents” \n# Select and confirm period. Result: Contents for this period are agreed upon.\n# Select section\n::Here, you can select a section of the employee review meeting which is not included in the overall employee review meeting (see also [[Period settings|Period settings]]) and agree on its contents. If you do not select a section here, then '''all active sections of the entire employee review meeting''' will be agreed upon.\n\n'''Automatically “pre-select” subareas''' <br>\nIf you use wizards, you can configure them so that the desired (sub)areas in the employee review meeting are automatically selected. To do this, use the '''DefaultAggregatorValue''' parameter and integrate it into the wizards. In the following example, after selecting the multiple action “Agree on contents,” the areas Goals, Tasks and Competencies would be selected/checked: \n* ''<nowiki>/Employment/Current?DefaultAggregatorValue=Aggregator_Obj|Aggregator_Tasks|Aggregator_Skills</nowiki>''\n\n:The list below shows the parameters for each subarea: \n:* '''Goals''': Aggregator_Obj\n:* '''Tasks''': Aggregator_Tasks\n:* '''Competencies''': Aggregator_Skills\n:* '''Development goals''': Aggregator_DevObj\n:* '''Behavioral criteria''': Aggregator_Behav\n:* '''Feedback''': Aggregator_Feedb\n\n===Complete the assessment===\nProcess for “Complete”: \n\n# Search for and select employees \n# Multiple action “Complete the assessment” \n# Select and confirm period\nResult: All assessments in the period are marked as completed.\n\n===Calculate bonus and salary===\nProcess for “Salary and bonus”: \n\n# Search for and select employees in [[Employee directory - Salary and bonus XY|Employee directory - Salary and bonus XY]]\n# Use multiple action “[[Use pre-calculated values for bonus & salary increase|Use pre-calculated values for bonus & salary increase]]”.\n# Then select more people and use the multiple action “[[Edit bonus and salary in a table|Edit bonus and salary in a table (max. 50)]]”\n# Make corrections by hand with the help of the budget diagram.\nResult: Salary increase and bonus proposals are calculated for all employees.\nPreparation: Formulas must be created and assigned.

We have a preconfigured default variant that you will very probably be able to use for your purposes. Nonetheless, we, too, need to do a bit of setup work if this needs to be changed. If you would like to find out about organigram options, or use them, please get in touch with our support team.\n\n==Change the organigram==\n\nYou can change the organigram via \"Settings\" - \"Set up organigram\", or by uploading the configuration file (p2o). There you will find the files which \"feed\" the organigram.\n\n===Employee data===\n\nHere you will find the \"employees.csv\". This file holds all the key data about the employees which will later be displayed in the organigram.\n\n===Successor data===\n\nHere you will find the \"successors.csv\" which contains the succession rule set.\n\n===Access table for HR and superiors===\n\nThe \"Zugriff.csv\" controls, in the organigram display, who is permitted to view the organigram and how, which content is to be shown or hidden.\n\n===User-defined report 1 for OrgCharts===\n\nThis is used as a placeholder for a new SQL that can be used to add functions to the organigram.\n\n===User-defined report 2 for OrgCharts===\n\nThis is used as a placeholder for a new SQL that can be used to add functions to the organigram.\n\n===Configuration file===\n\nIf you have customised your organigram, the p2o file is stored here. Clicking the small pencil on the right takes you to the editing window. Here the configuration file can be deleted and a new p2o file can be uploaded. If the p2o file is deleted from here, one accesses the umantis' default organigram once more.\n\nCare needs to be taken that the p2o file has your umantis customer ID and \"_umantis.p2o\" for its file name. E.g. for a file name: 76524439_umantis.p2o Every other file is ignored and not recognised as a configuration file by the system. In this case, one once more uses the default organigram file which is integrated when the organigram function is supplied. If you wish to upload a customised p2o file you need to carry out the following actions to reconcile the data with the server data: \"Update organigram\" or these processes: \"Provide data now\", \"Provide photos now\" and \"Copy data to server\".\n\n==Actions==\n\nYou will find the actions under: \"Settings\" - \"Organigram settings\"\n\n# Provide data now: Click the link to supply the changed data to the umantis system.\n# Provide photos now: Purely for the purposes of data provision, the photos can be stored separately in umantis and copied to the server.\n# Copy data to server: With this step the data that has been provided in the two preceding steps is copied to the server and can be viewed there.\n\n==Step by step==\n\nIf you have added a new employee or deleted an employee or updated images, you should carry out these steps:\n\n# You have updated employee data (excluding photos)\n# Click \"Update organigram (Employees - Actions \"Update organigram\")\n# Now all the data on the server is updated, (not photos)\n\n\nIf you want to update photos at the same time, follow these steps:\n\n# You have updated employee data (including photos)\n# Click \"Provide data now (Settings-Organigram Settings-Action \"Provide data now\")\n# Click \"Provide data now (Settings-Organigram Settings-Action \"Provide photos now\")\n# Click \"Provide data now (Settings-Organigram Settings-Action \"Copy data to server\")\n# Now all the data on the server is updated, (including photos)\n\n\nWhen these actions have been carried out, you should wait around 3 minutes before viewing the organigram, because a script runs in the background which carries out the data update process in the minute cycle and populates the relevant data folders with the new information.\n\nYou can find the \"Update organigram\" action under \"Employees\" on the left of the navigation. This action carries out the two actions \"Provide data now\" and \"Copy data to server\", one after the other with the correct waiting times. After this action you should, again, wait at least 3 minutes before viewing the organigram in order to give the internal update process time to do its work. It is important here that the action \"Provide photos now\" is not carried out at the same time. If photos also have to be updated, the action \"Provide photos now\" needs to be carried out beforehand, independently of \"Provide data now\", \"Copy data to server\" or \"Update organigram\".\n\n<br /> Useful to know:\n\n*  The individual csv files cannot be copied to umantis manually. They are only regenerated, regularly each night, by the SQL within umantis.\n*  The \"Update organigram\" action may not update new photos, so this needs to be done separately using the action \"Provide photos now\" (before the update process)."

This setting is similar to the “Participation to be approved by manager” setting in the event details. \n:: [[File:attention.gif]]  Note that even if the box is not checked, the participation must still be approved. The only effect of checking the box is that the manager’s name is automatically filled in as the initial approver.\n\n====Extensions to the approval process====\n:* '''Final approver for external events'''\n:: This person must issue final approval for an external event. Read the related comments under “Responsible event administrator”.\n:* '''Final approver for internal events'''\n:: The person indicated here must issue final approval for an internal event.

This is where the basic user settings for the employee, such as language, access permissions, etc. are defined. This page is displayed for the [[User roles in the employee management system#HR expert|HR expert]] and [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|Administrator]] roles.\n\n==Path==\nUse the following path to configure employee settings:\nFrom the '''Employees > Employee Directory''' tab, select the appropriate '''employee''',''' '''and then click on '''Settings''' in the employee file.\n\n==Settings==\nVarious employee settings can be configured here:\n===Personal settings===\n* '''Language'''\n: the employee's user language. This can be any of the [[Languages|languages]] defined in the main settings.\n\n* '''Time zone'''\n: The person’s time zone can be specified here. (If no time zone is explicitly indicated here, the system will automatically detect the browser’s time zone and assign it to the user.) \n\n* '''Role'''\n: [[User roles in the employee management system|the employee's user role]] [[File:Schloss_16.png]]\n\n* '''Is a setup administrator'''\n: People who have this option enabled can make adjustments in [[Configuration mode]] within the scope of their other access rights (roles and permissions). <br> [[File:info.gif]] The import variable is [[Description User import|[CWCAdmin]]]; the export variable is [Benutzer.IstEinrichtungsAdmin]. <br>Please note that this setting is not available for administrators.\n\n* '''Login data'''\n: the user's login, and the date of the most recent password change and login by this user.\n\n* '''Settings for Knowledge and Network'''\n: indicates whether the employee may access [[Network groups|network groups]] module, and whether their profile should be displayed on the network. [[File:Schloss_16.png]]  The person is still visible to network administrators, but a note is added: \"This person is only visible to network administrators.\" The reason for this is the need to control access rights for network users.\n\n===Settings for events===\n* '''Settings for instructors'''\n:* ''Is an instructor''\n:: Anyone marked here as \"Is an instructor\" will also be added to the list of [[Instructors|instructors]]. The subject area and the instructor's plan for the course can be maintained through his/her special [[Access as an instructor|access as an instructor]]. \n:* ''Can edit own events''\n:: Indicate here whether the instructor is allowed to edit his/her own events or not. This setting can be imported by means of the variable '''[Person.IstReferentAdmin]''' — see [[Description Employee-Jobs Import|Description of employee jobs import]].\n\n* '''Settings for instructors and event administrators'''\n: An email notification for event administrators and instructors can be set up here; the notification is triggered when a participant changes to one of the participation statuses specified here. \n \n* '''Development program'''\n: An employee can be assigned to participate regularly in certain events. Searches then help the employee and their manager to find events that fit with their [[Development program|development program]]. \n\n===Import settings===\n* '''Import settings''' \n:* ''Key fields''\n:: the person key, job key and source system key are the key criteria for the import and export. If you change these entries, the person will not be found in the next import; a new person and/or job will be created instead. If a person has been copied to a different source system, the keys may be modified here BEFORE the new import. The combination of source system key and person key is the deciding factor in finding the person. The combination of all three criteria is the deciding factor in finding the job in the import. If the keys are left empty when the employee is created, the employee's Haufe ID is automatically used as the event key. These values are used for exports and re-imports, and may not be left empty.\n:* ''Deactivate import for the following fields''\n:: Please select the employee settings that should not be subject to change via import.  If one of these fields is selected, it will no longer be overwritten by employee imports for this user. \n\n===Settings for employee review meeting===\n* '''Activated content for the employee review meeting'''\n: For each employee, you can specify which content should be available for the employee review meeting. Anything not set to \"Yes\" here will be hidden in the \"Employee review meetings\" tab for this employee.\n\n* '''Default settings for employee review meeting'''\n: Define the default settings that should apply to employee review meetings. Be sure to also observe the [[Modules & Accesses|Settings for employee review meetings]] specified in the main settings.\n\n* '''ERM process control by the employee'''\n: Under this point, you can specify the \"scope of action\" accorded to employees for their employee review meetings.\n::O Employees can agree on contents and complete assessments.\n::O Employees can complete assessments.\n::O Employees can agree on contents.

(default setting)\n::O Employees can modify completed assessments if needed.\n::O Employees can modify agreed-upon content if needed.\n::O Employees may NOT modify agreed-upon content or completed assessments.\n: [[File:attention.gif]]  This specific setting overwrites the general main settings.\n\n==Access [[File:Schloss_16.png]]==\nThis is where accesses are defined for all users, except for the employee role. Default settings for newly created employees can be specified under [[Modules & Accesses|Modules & Accesses]] in the main settings.\n\n===Access to modules===\nEnter all the [[User roles in the employee management system#Access to modules|modules]] to which the user should have access. Unauthorized modules are automatically hidden from this user.\n\n===Access to organizational units===\nUse the \"Configure organizational units\" link to select all organizational units to which this person should have access in the manager view. Access to an organizational unit means that, in the manager view, the person has access to all employees who have been assigned to this organizational unit through their [[Job profile (employee management)|job profile]]. It also controls the selection list of organizational units for this employee. \n\nAccess to organizational units is only available if the user has at least the role of [[User roles in the employee management system#Manager with access to direct subordinates and other organizational units|Manager with access to direct subordinates and other organizational units]], or the [[User roles in the employee management system#Events (administrators)|Events (Administrator)]] module role. Access to organizational units can only be granted by someone who can access that organizational unit him/herself.\n\nThe matrix organizational units can be used to construct a second, parallel access structure; for example, professional responsibilities from a matrix organization. Assignment works in the same way as for the primary organizational units.\n\n* '''[[File:attention.gif]] If access to organizational units cannot be shared,'''\n: check whether the name of the organizational unit contains disallowed characters. For example: $$\n\n===Access to salary data===\nAccess to salary data can be defined separately. If none of the four options is selected here, the user will not be able to access any employee's salary data.\n\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:400px\"> Archive (PKI settings) <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n==PKI settings==\n[[File:attention.gif]] '''''PKI not supported as of end 2018'''''\n\nThis view is displayed when \"Use PKI\" is checked under \"SSO\" in the [[Security settings|security settings]]. The values from the employee's user certificate can then be entered here. However, these values are usually imported by means of the [[Imports|employee master data import]].\n\n</div></div>\n\n==Linked users & access profiles==\nFor more details, see [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Linked user profiles or access roles]].\n\n==Settings for aconso==\nEmployee settings for [[Aconso - Digital personnel file|aconso]] can be configured in the settings for individual employees.\n\n==Profile links==\n* ''Releasing personal links'' (1–3)\n: Releasing a personal link causes various ([[Parse links|variable]]) links to be displayed in the action bar of the person’s [[Employee file#Business card|business card]].\n\n'''''Employee profile created on (date)'''''\n\n==Change log (settings)==\n[[File:History.png]] '''Modification history'''<br>\n\nA change log with the following information can be viewed here: \n* ''Modification history (“Person” settings)''\n* ''Modification history (“Job” settings)''\n\nThis change log lists the history of changes made to settings for the person and the job. Once you have opened it, you can view the following information about each change/modification: \n:* The field that was modified (e.g. “Development potential” or “Risk of leaving”)\n:* Previous value\n:* New value\n:* User who made the change\n:* Date/Time of change\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The change log is accessible to the following user roles (if [[Configuration mode|enabled for display]]):\n* [[User roles in the employee management system#HR expert|HR expert]]\n* [[User roles in the employee management system#System administrator|Administrator]]\n\n==Actions==\n\n; Login data\n* [[Send a new password|Send new login data]]\n* Set new password\n\n; Reminders\n* [[Enter new reminder|Create reminder for employee]]\n[[File:GDPR.png|50px]]\n; Access rights\n* '''People with access to this job'''\n: This link provides an overview of everyone who has access to this job.\n* '''Block access to person'''\n\n: Administrators can completely block access to a person profile through all profile views and for all permission levels, and unblock it again if needed. When access to a person is blocked, that person is no longer visible for anyone; as such, no one can view, edit or delete any information about the person. \n----\n; Linked users & access profiles\n* [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Set up alternate]]\n* [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Set up additional access rights to this employee profile]]\n* [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Set up access to another user profile in Employee Management]]\n* [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Set up access to another user profile in Applicant Management]]\n* [[Linked user profiles or access roles|Set up access to another user profile in a third-party system]]"

Succession planning aims to minimize the [[Job profile (employee management)#Identification of key positions|risk of a job not being filled]]. Succession planning well in advance is particularly essential for jobs that have been defined as critical [[Job profile (employee management)#Key positions|key positions]]. \nSuccession planning is mainly based on company objectives and (future) skills requirements. Firstly, the objectives are established and the general situation is clarified (e.g. budget restrictions), giving a basis for then planning the various measures. __FORCETOC__\n<br>\n__TOC__\n==Identify potential successors==\nAfter establishing the key positions for succession planning, potential successors can be assigned to each job. There are different ways to find potential successors:\n* Manually assign potential successors to the job\n* Use the interactive search\n* Advertise the job within the company area (employees nominate themselves)\nCriteria from the employee review meeting, such as development potential or risk of leaving, may also help with selections.\n\n==Using the interactive search to assign potential successors==\n[[File:Interaktive Suche.JPG|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 1: The interactive search and succession function profile connection displayed]]\nIf you want to find a potential successor using the interactive search, it is a good idea to run the search based on a [[Function profiles|function profile]].\n\nIf you opt for this method, a succession [[Function profiles|function profile]] should first be assigned to the job. This is usually identical to the current function profile. You then choose the option “Copy search criteria for interactive search from succession function profile.” When you then run the interactive search, the criteria which are identical to the [[Function profiles|function profile]] are automatically selected.\nHowever, you can run the interactive search without assigning a [[Function profiles|function profile]] by setting the search filters manually.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] So, for succession planning to be reliable, it is advisable to go to [[Settings for company / organization profile|Settings]] and select the [[Settings for company / organization profile#Company profile in Employee Management|job ID is “unique”]] option. Succession planning for previous positions is thereby maintained for other jobs with the same keys and can be continued. The key factor here is the combination of the job keys, or the source key in combination.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] Note the [[Competencies#Competencies vs. Skills|difference between competencies and skills.]]\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<div class=\"toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:800px\"> '''Interactive search in succession planning: all the fields that are searched'''   (click on \"Expand\") <div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\"> \n[[File:info.gif]] Note that, by default, some of the fields in the list that follows are [[Configuration mode|hidden]]. \n\n'''Potential and Risk'''\n* Development potential\n* Potential function area\n* Potential managerial responsibility\n* Potential position\n* Potential user-defined list 1–7\n* Risk of leaving\n----\n<br>\n'''Potential self-assessment'''\n* Development potential self-assessment\n* Potential function area self-assessment\n* Potential managerial responsibility self-assessment\n* Potential position self-assessment\n* Potential user-defined list self-assessment (1–7) \n----\n'''Professional experience'''\n* Experience in country \n* Industry experience\n* Experience in position\n* Experience of managerial responsibility\n* Experience user-defined list 1–3 \n'''Education'''\n* Education in country \n* Area of study\n* Education level\n* Education user-defined list 1–3\n'''Academic studies'''\n* Academic studies in country \n* Degree course\n* Degree\n* Academic studies user-defined list 1–3\n'''Training''' \n* Development category\n* Training in country\n* Training area of study\n* Training qualification\n* Training user-defined list 1–3\n'''Skills and competencies'''\n* Language skills\n* General skills\n* IT skills\n* Technical skills\n* Methods expertise\n* Soft skills\n* User-defined competencies list 6\n* Knowledge in the field of film and television\n* User-defined competencies list 8–12\n* Driver's license\n* Gender\n\n</div></div>\n<br>\n\n==Development of potential successors==\nIf you have assigned potential successors to a job, the next step is to use various criteria, e.g. readiness, to assess and prioritize them. To help, you can compare the candidates to one another or display the suitability of a potential successor for the relevant [[Job profile (employee management)|position profile]] in graphic form ([[File:bar_graph.JPG]]). \nBy displaying their suitability graphically and comparing them to other potential successors, your candidates can pursue goal-based development and be helped in a focused way by participating in development programs. \n<br />\nTowards the end of the succession planning process, i.e. when the potential successors have been assigned, the planned successor is usually named.\n<br>\n\n==Succession Planning Complexity and Organigram==\nSuccession planning can sometimes be highly complex and certain aspects should be given particular attention.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Resulting Chain Reaction''': When an employee is assigned to a job as a potential successor there is a chain reaction, since the employee’s current job will also have to be filled.\n\n[[File:Info.gif]] '''Risk of Over-planning''': Since an employee can usually only occupy one job, there is a need to keep an eye on how many jobs the employee has been nominated for as a potential successor.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe [[Organigram|organigram]] is a useful succession planning tool, for example by showing the complexity described.\n[[File:Succession Planning EN without text.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 2: An example which clarifies succession planning]]\n[[File:Organigramm without text2.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Fig. 3: An organigram as a visualization tool]]\n<br /><br /><br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"background-color:#E0E0E0;\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of Figure 2\n|-\n|\nPerson P4 does job S4, which is a so-called key position.

Which managers are allowed to see which poll depends on whether there are already answers that a direct report of this manager has already provided to precisely this poll. This type of poll must be answered in the employee area (not public), because the job information is important.\n\n==Actions in the polls overview==\n*  [[Create new survey|Create new poll]]\n\n==Multiple actions in the polls overview==\n*  [[Change Status|Change status]] (for controlling internal processes)\n*  Start/continue (poll can be answered)\n*  Freeze (poll may be temporarily stopped)\n*  Archive (poll is filtered out of the polls overview by default)\n*  Reactivate (poll which was completed is activated again)\n\n==Actions on the poll itself==\n*  Start poll/poll in process\n*  Freeze poll (no more responses may be submitted, the poll is not completed, however)\n*  Archive poll\n*  Copy poll (copies the poll 1:1, but the name should be changed)\n*  Clear poll\n*  Release poll for the global area (releases the poll in the various languages recorded for the respective users)\n*  Enter reminder for this poll\n*  Overview of poll result\n\n==Working with polls==\n\nA poll can be started, frozen, continued, and archived. First, create a poll and enter the associated questions. Subsequently, the poll may be started either immediately or you can set a reminder, so that you can start or stop the poll in a timely manner. A green dot indicates that the poll can currently be responded to. (The \"Start\" and \"End\" fields in the poll do NOT have any affect here).<br /><br />When the poll time has expired and before any decisions are made based on it, the poll should be frozen because this prevents it from being changed thereafter. This function is equal to a pause or start button. Frozen polls are marked by a snowflake. Freezing can be undone by continuing the poll. As a result, the poll is in the same state as immediately after the start and re-appears with a green dot. If the poll is no longer relevant, it can be archived. However, it will remain in the database, including its results and evaluations, the only difference is that it is filtered out from the overview but can be re-displayed with \"reset search\".  You should also make use of the wizards to greatly improve the [[Create new survey#Ease of use when answering a poll|Comfort when responding to polls]].\n\n===Diagrams for polls===\n\nSeveral poll questions may be included in a graphical analysis using diagrams. In the evaluation, '''all shared polls of a poll no. are included''', i. e. the poll will be evaluated '''globally'''. This can be useful with respect to recurring polls such as about employee or customer satisfaction. A poll is considered global, as soon as \"Release poll for global comparison\" is selected. \n\nAfter clicking on «Release survey for global comparison» this survey can be released only if\n\n*  No poll has been released yet with this poll number \n*  this survey matches exactly with a previously released survey (exactly the same survey number and exactly the same questions)\n\nThus, only surveys with the same survey number, as well as exactly the same questions and answers reach the same evaluation. \n\nA global release is only possible, however, if concrete answer options are specified in at least one question, i. e. in a poll with only free-text fields no global release is possible. After the release, the poll can no longer be changed.\n\n===Using polls for exit interview===\n\nFor exit interviews it is important that the responses are anonymous and still recorded in a structured manner in order to perform analyses regarding the reason for terminating employment. At the same time, information shall be shared and recorded in a personal conversation. The responses are therefore usually not collected in the solution by the employees themselves, but by HR. Therefore, the responses in the internal area may be collected by HR, even in case of anonymous polls. This way, by clicking on the link \"answer questions\", all responses will be recorded first of all, and the link to the employee is subsequently deleted in the overview of the poll participants. Instead of the name of the person, only \"anonymous\" appears. <br /> [[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] Responses can be recorded only once and cannot be edited subsequently.\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  [[Surveys|Polls]]\n*  [[Create new survey|Create new poll]]\n*  [[Survey analyses|Analysis of polls]]"

Navigate to the appropriate place in the solution via ''Employees > Employee directory > Select employee > Performance and development''. Here you can either click “Request evaluation by a third party” in the action bar or “Add third-party assessor” in the third-party assessment overview.  \n\n===Invitation for third-party assessment===\nAfter clicking '''“Request evaluation by a third party”''' or '''“Add third-party assessor”''', the following overview is displayed:\n\n* '''Third-party assessor:''' \n:In this field, enter the person(s) to whom you want to send an invitation for a third-party assessment. \n\n: [[File:info.gif]] Using [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] and the hide and display function, the administrator can define whether the third party assessors (cf. Fig. 1) should be:\n:* external and internal persons (upper field is displayed)\n::or \n:* only (active) employees (lower field is displayed)<br>\n:[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note:''' The two fields should NEVER be displayed at the same time. The typeahead function is active for both fields, i.e. persons from the employee directory are displayed as suggestions as the user types. \n:Once you have specified the person, you can customize the message to the third party assessor (based on the template for [[System e-mails|system emails]]) and can specify which contents are to be assessed. An assessment deadline (see next point) and internal comments can be added as well.<br>\n:: '''Assessment deadline / ''Assess by'''''\n:: When sending an invitation for a third-party assessment, you can specify an assessment deadline. This is a fixed date by which the assessment must be completed by the person being invited.<br>\n:[[File:Info.gif‎]] Please note that in accordance with [[Information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] guidelines, the typeahead function is restricted to comply with access rights.  \n[[File:attention.gif]] '''Note:''' A value of 4 weeks is saved in this field if you do not enter a specific date. However, please note that the date you enter must be at least 3 days and at most 90 days in the future. Once the specified date has passed, it is no longer possible to submit an assessment.

As described above, this results in two fields, of which only one is shown or hidden in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]] (see note above).\n: Three checkboxes are available to make it easier for you to invite people by pooling a certain group of people together. \n:* '''Checkboxes:'''\n:** All of this manager’s direct subordinates\n:** All employees of the same organizational unit\n:** All other responsible persons\n:* '''Invitation by email:'''\n:** Email comment: Sent in addition to the default email (based on the [[System e-mails|system emails]]).\n:** The following contents should be assessed: Definition of the content to be evaluated and setting of the evaluation term. In addition, you can save an internal comment.\n\n====Select suggested third-party assessor====\nThe system helps you to select the recipients for your invitation to a third-party assessment. A list of people is provided to help you quickly and intuitively select the people that you would like to invite to submit an assessment. The list that is displayed is based on your most recently sent invitations to third-party assessments, and is updated automatically. The list also includes information about which [[#Beziehungstypen bei der Drittbeurteilung|Relationship type]] each person represents.  \n\n[[File:info.gif]] The list of “''Select suggested third-party assessors''” includes the employee’s manager and that manager's manager. Other supervisors and employees from the same organizational unit are also listed here. If the person being assessed occupies a manager role, then their direct subordinates are also included in this list. Finally, all third-party assessors (employees and external individuals) from the last 1.5 years are listed here as well.\n\n==Third-party assessors==\n''The people who are invited to provide their assessment are referred to as third-party assessors. An “evaluation by a third party” can be collected anonymously or non-anonymously.'' \n\nWhen activating third-party assessment for certain subareas of the employee review meeting, we recommend that you also [[Configuration mode|display]] the overview table of '''Third-party assessors''' in the relevant subarea. Depending on the type of third-party assessment you are using (anonymous or non-anonymous), this overview includes the following information and possible actions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[File:Drittbeurteilende.png|border|900px]]\n! Icon/Action\n! Description \n|-\n| [[File:Reminder-Icon.JPG|20px|center]]\n| Send email/reminder. Be sure to take note of the [[#Automatische E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen/Erinnerungen|Automatic email notifications/reminders]]. <br>[[File:info.gif]] Reminder emails cannot be sent when using [[#Anonyme Drittbeurteilung|anonymous third-party assessment]].\n|-\n| [[File:Pen-Icon.JPG|20px|center]]\n| Edit the contents to be assessed and [[#Beziehungstypen bei der Drittbeurteilung|relationship type]] and/or write a comment.\n|-\n| [[File:Rubbish-icon.JPG|20px|center]]\n| Delete assessment.\n|-\n| [[File:Watching-Icon.JPG|20px|center]]\n| View assessment. Only displayed after the assessment has been completed.\n|}\n\n[[File:info.gif]] Please note that special rules apply for the displayed content when using anonymous third-party assessment (depending e.g. on the [[Period settings|period settings]]).\n\n===Conduct third-party assessment===\nAs mentioned [[#Einschätzung Dritter einholen (Drittbeurteilung)|above]], the people invited to provide a third-party assessment can access the assessment form through the [[Linking using emails in employee management|link in the email]]. The assessment form shows all elements that are released to third parties for assessment.<br>\n \n[[File:info.gif]] Note that for non-anonymous assessments, the assessment entered by the third-party assessor is only visible to the “sender” if the third-party assessor has released their content. The content is released through the action “Release my assessment and send notification”.\n\n===Relationship types for third-party assessment===\nThe system helps you to select the recipients for your invitation to a third-party assessment. The list of people you see also includes information about which relationship type each person represents. A relationship type reflects the relation between the person being assessed and the person being invited (third-party assessor). The relationship type can include ''co-worker'', ''manager'', or ''direct report'' (= employee) relationships. The relationship type available for selection is based on information from your Haufe system (including the current organizational structure). If an incorrect relationship type is shown for a given person, it can be modified in the [[#Drittbeurteiler/Drittbeurteilende|third-party assessor’s]] view after the invitation is sent.\n\n'''Please note the following points:''' \n* [[Period settings#Composition of proposed list of third-party assessors|Composition of proposed list of third-party assessors]]\n* For [[#Anonyme Drittbeurteilung|anonymous third-party assessments]], you must normally invite at least three people for each relationship type (except “Manager”).\n* When inviting people for the “Manager” relationship type, no minimum number applies. Background: Most employees have only one manager, so no restriction (minimum number) can be imposed for this relationship type for anonymous third-party assessment. \n* If only one manager is invited to provide a third-party assessment, his or her assessment is visible as a manager assessment through a report.\n\n===Combinations of relationship types and their effects (anonymous third-party assessment)===\n\n'''General rules'''\n# Alongside the “Manager” relationship type, which plays a special role in the system, the “Co-workers” and “Direct reports” relationship types are included in a second group.\n# For managers, the relationship is always saved — except if a total of '''fewer than three''' people are invited in the other group. The reason is that in such cases, anonymity could not be ensured for this group.\n# For the “Co-workers” and “Direct reports” group, both relationship types must have '''3 or more''' people invited in order for these relationship types to be written and displayed while still ensuring anonymity. \n# If the number of people invited for a given relationship type is '''equal to zero''' (no people invited), then this relationship type will not be written to the result, and will therefore not be displayed.  \n\nThe following examples show the possible combinations of invited relationship types, and the associated effects on how results are displayed for [[#Anonyme Drittbeurteilung|anonymous third-party assessments]]. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

If they have not yet submitted their assessment, they will receive:\n:* the first email '''three days before the assessment deadline''', <br>and \n:* the second email '''one day before the deadline'''. \n\n:The [[System e-mails|system email]] used here is “''Request evaluation by a third party: Invitation to assessment''” (code: '''''SystemTemplate_Ask4ThirdAppraisalNew'''''). Note that this reminder email will only be sent if the third-party assessor has '''not yet submitted their assessment'''.\n\n;Notification email for anonymous third-party assessment\n:For [[#Anonyme Drittbeurteilung|anonymous third-party assessment]], an automatic email notification is sent to the person being assessed after the assessment deadline has expired. In this way, the person is informed that the third-party assessment round is complete.\n\n:[[File:info.gif]] The email to be sent in this case can be modified as needed in the [[System e-mails|system emails]] (under ''/Administration/SystemTemplates'', code: '''''SystemTemplate_AnoymThirdAppraisalReady''''').\n\n==Anonymous third-party assessment==\n\nThe Haufe system allows you to conduct anonymous third-party assessments. This process can be used e.g. if the company does not have an open feedback culture, and if there should therefore be no possibility of tracing assessments received from third parties. This often allows third parties to provide more candid feedback/assessments. \n\n; [[File:attention.gif]]  '''Important notes'''\n* Always configure the [[Period settings|period settings]] '''first''' so that you can then start the round of employee review meetings or third-party assessments after that. To avoid undesirable and/or erroneous behavior, avoid making changes later on to the period settings for periods that are already active.\n* When activated, anonymous third-party assessments can only be started from the relevant subarea of the employee review meeting, and not from the overall assessment.\n* Please note that when anonymous third-party assessments are used, the person being assessed sees no information about the status of the given third-party assessment, and thus cannot send reminders to the third-party assessor.\n* Certain '''possible actions in the employee review meeting process''' are dependent on how the period settings have been defined (e.g. the actions to “'''''Create/Add to list of third-party assessors for anonymous assessment'''''” and “'''''Start anonymous third-party assessment round and send invitations'''''”).\n* Note that for anonymous third-party assessments, '''no minimum number''' of invitees is imposed for the “Manager” [[#Beziehungstypen bei der Drittbeurteilung|relationship type]]. For all other relationship types (co-workers, direct subordinates, project partners, etc.), at least three people must be invited when using anonymous third-party assessments.\n* If only one manager is invited to provide a third-party assessment, his or her assessment is visible as a manager assessment through a report (cf. [[#Beziehungstypen bei der Drittbeurteilung|Relationship types]]).\n* Reminders/reminder emails cannot be sent manually when using anonymous third-party assessment. Take note here of the information provided under [[#Automatische E-Mail-Benachrichtigungen/Erinnerungen|Automatic email notifications/reminders]]\n\n===Settings for anonymous third-party assessments===\n\n[[File:info.gif]] The settings for anonymous third-party assessments are found in the [[Period settings|period settings]] for your Haufe solution (''/Administration/Periods/[ID]/Profile/Settings''). \n\nAmong other settings, you will specify here which rules should apply for the third-party assessment in the employee review meeting: \n* Contents not individually selectable for subareas\n* Anonymous assessment for subareas\n* Minimum number of anonymous third-party assessors for subareas\n* Average of third-party assessments as manager assessment for subareas\n* Minimum number of third-party assessments to allow average to be displayed for '''non'''-anonymous assessment\n* Minimum number of third-party assessments to allow average to be displayed for anonymous assessment\n* Minimum number of assessments to trigger discarded result for '''non'''-anonymous assessment\n* Minimum number of assessments to trigger discarded result for anonymous assessment\n\n'''See the following page for detailed information on the individual setting options: [[Period settings#Overall assessment – Employee review meeting (ERM)|Period settings – Third-party assessment – Employee review meeting (ERM)]]'''\n\n==FAQs about third-party assessment==\n* '''How much time do I have to submit an assessment?''' \n: '''A:''' An assessment can be submitted as long as the employee review meeting has not been completed or suspended, and the deadline for third-party assessments has not passed. \n* '''What if the employee review meeting has been completed for the period — can I still confirm something regarding the third-party assessment?''' \n: '''A:''' No, this is not possible. The employee review meeting is complete. If you follow the link, you will be forwarded to a page with a notification to that effect. \n* '''I want to modify my assessment – how do I do this?'''\n: '''A:''' Click the link in your invitation to the assessment.

Those settings include options for \"Has access\" and \"Is displayed\" — see [[Settings in employee file|Settings in employee file]].\n\n==Additional roles==\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|width=\"20%\"|'''Role'''\n|width=\"40%\"|'''Description'''\n|width=\"40%\"|'''[[File:Schloss_16.png]] Access'''\n|-\n|\n===External individuals===\n||Anyone who does not have (or no longer has) a position within the company is automatically categorized as an external individual. An external individual is the opposite of an employee. Every person in the system is either an employee or an external individual. Employees have one of the user roles mentioned above. External individuals do not have or need such roles. Typically, these are external consultants, instructors, former employees / alumni or even customers. External individuals can freely organize themselves into groups on the network and exchange their knowledge. Module roles cannot be assigned to external individuals. <br> [[File:attention.gif]] Please make sure that you do not assign a role to a historicized employee (= external person), as this will result in the denial of access to the person concerned. The external person is not allowed to have a role for their access to the Public area.||style=\"width: 100px;\"|— [[Access as an external person|Public view]]\n|-\n|\n\n===Instructors===\n||Any person in the system can be an instructor. This simply requires that the employee or external individual be marked as \"Is an instructor\" in their personal settings. Instructors can be assigned/booked for events. ||style=\"width: 100px;\"|— [[Access as an instructor|Instructor view]]\n\n|-\n|\n===Setup administrator===\n||A person for whom this role is activated can perform configurations in [[Configuration mode|configuration mode]], in the context of their other access rights and module rights. ||style=\"width: 100px;\"|— Settings<br>— Relevant view for role and module access\n\n\n|}\n\n==Access to modules [[File:Schloss_16.png]]==\n'''Modules''': In the [[Settings in employee file|settings]] for each employee, you can specify which of the available modules the employee should have access to.\nAs a general rule, any user role can be combined with any module, except for the \"Employee\" user role. Employees can only acquire additional privileges in Umantis [[Employee management|Employee Management]] through the assignment of additional access profiles. Module roles cannot be assigned to external individuals.\n{| border=\"1px\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|'''Module'''||'''Description'''\n|-\n|\n===Goals and tasks (ERM)===\n|| Employees with access to this module can create goals and tasks for the employee review meeting, and agree on them with their subordinates.\n|-\n|\n===Personnel development (ERM)===\n|| Employees with access to this module can enter competencies, development goals, conduct and feedback for the employee review meeting, and agree on them with their subordinates. They also have access to employees' potential.\n|-\n|\n===Succession planning===\n|| People with this module are permitted to perform and administer succession planning. They are free to integrate their employees into the succession planning. The same access rules apply to individual jobs for succession planning as for employee jobs (organizational units and manager assignment).\n|-\n|\n===Events (administrators)===\n|| Event administrators can administer all events that are assigned to their organizational units. They can control publications and manage participants, instructors and resources.\n|-\n|\n===Events (users)===\n|| Event users are usually managers. They can register their employees for events that are already published. This is equivalent to the function by which employees can register themselves for the event in the employee view.\n|-\n|\n===Analytics (dashboards and ad-hocs)===\n||Analytics is an umbrella term for dashboards (diagrams) and ad-hoc reports (Excel report templates). A person to whom this module has been assigned can create and configure diagrams and Excel report templates. However, this function is very technically demanding.\n|-\n|\n===Surveys===\n||A person to whom the \"Surveys\" module is assigned can create surveys, invite participants, and start or end the survey. If a survey is marked in the \"Settings\" as \"Visible for managers\", then managers do not need to have this module role, and the survey will also be visible to the managers of survey participants. This is useful, for instance, if a survey is used as manager feedback.\n|-\n|\n\n===Imports===\n||Employees with access to this module can initiate imports of any kind. Assigning this module role is very similar to assigning administrator status, since an import can also be used to create new administrators, thereby clearing the way to unrestricted access to the entire system. Any user with access rights to imports can edit an employee's person and job IDs. For example, this means that HR experts and managers can also see and edit the ID fields.  \n|-\n|\n\n===Org chart===\n||A person to whom this module role is assigned can see the org chart for the company alongside the employee overview. This module is tied to an external provider and must be specially configured.\n|-\n|\n===all salary/bonuses===\n||This module, also known as \"Compensation\", allows for a very flexible calculation of salary increase and bonus proposals for employees, based on their performance. Managers with access to this module have good control over employees' salary structure. It is a good idea to assign the \"Goals and tasks (ERM)\" and \"Personnel development (ERM)\" modules to these managers as well.\n|-\n|\n===Exports===\n||The Exports module role gives an employee the ability to configure export templates for the company. Since there is certain sensitive content that should not appear in a freely available export template, this module role was created so that it could be made available specifically to selected employees. People with the Exports module role are therefore responsible for creating secure templates, and for setting access rights correctly. A person with this role has access to export '''templates'''. Access to exports in general (not to export '''templates'''!) is not affected by the assignment of this module role.  \n|-\n|\n\n===Communication===\n||The Communication module role gives an employee the ability to configure email, letter and print templates for the company. Since there is certain sensitive content that should not appear in freely available templates, this module role was created so that it could be made available specifically to selected employees. People with the Communication module role are therefore responsible for creating secure templates, and for setting access rights correctly.\n|-\n|\n\n===manages networks===\n||A network administrator can administer all groups on the network. In general, a person with this role is responsible for ensuring that groups are manageable and legally unobjectionable. Groups are administered only in the employee view (or in the public view for external individuals).\n|-\n|\n\n===Employee file===\n||With the \"Employee file\" module role, you have access to the following content from the employee file: Master data, job profile, salary, resume, skills, events, notes and documents\t\n|}"

A detailed description of all possible fields that can be [[Configuration mode|displayed]] and filled out when creating an event is provided in the section below.\n\n==Special features in the \"Options\" section==\nUse the checkboxes for \"External event\" and \"Online registration and cancellation allowed\" to specify which options apply for this event. If you do not check the box for \"Online registration and cancellation allowed\", then [[Employee|employees]] and [[Externe Personen|external individuals]] cannot register for the event or cancel their participation.\n\nYou can also specify what should happen when the maximum number of participants is reached.

The name of the approver can be noted in the \"Participation must be approved by\" field. \n\n[[File:info.gif]] For more information about approving event participation, see [[Registration details|Registration details]].\n\n===Notes on email notifications and the approval process===\n\nWhen you add employees to an event, up to five additional approvers can be added directly with the \"Start approval process and send first email\" option. With this option, you can also then indicate whether you want to be informed by email when the decision process for this person's participation in the event is completed.

By default, subordinate organizational units are not included. \n\n'''''Example''''': An event is released for organizational unit A. An employee with access to organizational unit AA (a sub-organization of A), but not to A itself, cannot administer this event. You can specify separately whether subordinate organizational units should also be included (check the box for \"Include subordinate organizational units\").\n<br><br>Note that this setting has no effect on how the published [[Events|event]] is displayed in the [[Catalog of events|event catalog]]. However, an employee can use the event search to find only events for their own organizational unit by checking the box for \"My events only\".\n\n==Certificate settings==\nYou can enter certificate data here (-> see also [[Event details#Certificate settings|Certificate settings]]).\n\n==Create event in detail==\nThe list below includes '''all''' the possible fields that can be displayed and filled out when creating an event.\n\n* '''Event number'''\n:If you leave this field empty, a number will be automatically generated and saved.

In general, these people are handled in exactly the same way as the person whose name is specified in the “Responsible” field. However, other people responsible for the event cannot be imported, only exported (by means of the [Event.MoreResponsibleAdmins] variable).\n* Registration options (e.g. [[Waiting list and change bookings|waiting list]])\n* '''Event series'''\t\n* '''Event category'''\t\n* '''Event type'''\t\n* '''Event organizer'''\t\n* '''Short description for overview'''\t\n:This text is presented in the events overview as a brief summary.\n* '''Start and end of event sessions (dates)'''\n: Here, you can add/create multiple event sessions (dates).\n* '''Start'''\t\n:If you enter a date, then a time must be added as well.

						"__text": "[[Category:Employee management]]\n\n[[Category:Objectives]]\n\n[[Category:Development]]\n\nYou create content for employee review meeting catalogs in order to save important recurring content for a job and with the same type. From there, every new agreement fetches this content via [[Objectives|objectives]], [[Job tasks|job tasks]], [[Competencies|skills]], [[Development objectives|development goals]], [[Behavioral criteria|behavioral criteria]] and  feedback questions. You will find the employee review meeting catalogs in the [[Company|Company]] tab.\n\nYou can also then link employee meeting catalogs to [[Function profiles|job profiles]] in order to with it be able to simplify the evaluations.\n\n==Assigning employee review meeting catalogs==\n\nIt may indeed make sense to link employee review catalogs with job profiles so that with it an evaluation grid can be generated for the meetings. Employee review meeting catalogs that are linked to job profiles can then be supplemented with job profile-specific target values [[Employee review meeting catalogues#Define scheduled values for skills|Targets]] You have two possibility to assign employee review meeting catalogs:\n\n* '''Copy employee review meeting catalogs directly to the employee for evaluation:'''You can find this copy function as a multiple action in the employees overview and as a one-off function in the employee review meeting for each employee. However, the assigning of catalogs needs to be repeated each evaluation period which, depending on the complexity, which involves some extra work and, therefore may also increase the likelihood of errors.<br />\n* '''Assigning job profiles:''' You can also assign employee review meeting catalogs directly under the job profiles using the relevant job profile request.\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] The employee review catalogs can be filled in in more than one language. However, if you are applying the catalogs to the employees in the employee review meeting they will only be copied in the employee's language. If the employee's language has not been defined, the main language of the software configured under Settings is used.\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] In order to be able to edit the content in the respective job profile, the catalog status must be set to \"in progress\".\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] If target are included in the list, they should be shown in the evaluation grid of the employee review meeting (see [[Configuration mode|Adjustment mode]]).\n\n==Define targets for competencies==\n\nTargets are suitable for defining a kind of guideline structure for [[Function profiles|job profiles]], which the employee should be able to meet as best as possible.\n\nA relative evaluation in the employee evaluation meeting with selection values such as \"achieved\" or \"surpassed\" is especially suitable for defining requirements in the job profiles and also for comparing targets with the relevant employee or with the employee review meeting catalog. As relates to the scale for evaluating the targets, this can either be a relative scale (\"achieved\", \"surpassed\", etc.) or it can also be an absolute scaling procedure (points, school grades, etc.). This evaluation also requires a legend, in which the scale is explained (e.g. grades, points, etc.).\n\n* '''Example: Relative:'''\n\nSkill: \"Communication\", target value/supplementary description: \"Appears confident to the department and to committees, presents clearly, has an open, genuine manner\", Evaluation: \"Achieved\"\n\n* '''Example: Absolute:'''\n\nSkill: \"Communication\", target value: \"3\" ,  Evaluation: \"5\"\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] If your company includes especially comprehensive skills catalogs, for which not all entries are relevant for each job profile, then by entering a target what occurs is that only the relevant values for the actual evaluation is copied to the [[Employee review meeting|employee evaluation meeting]]. For this purpose, click in the relevant job profile on \"Set targets\" and there, in settings, select the checkbox \"Only evaluation entries with targets\". If you now copy content into the [[Employee review meeting|employee evaluation meeting]], all content without targets are ignored.\n\n==Integrating content from the employee review meeting catalogs into the employee review meeting.==\n\nIn the employee overview, when preparing an employee review meeting, all  employee review meeting content that is linked in function profiles can be copied to the relevant agreement period. It can then, if required, be made more personal and, later, agreed in the conversation with the employee.  Copying the content has the advantage that you always retain the content that was evaluated in the original even when catalogs change as the years go by.\n\n'''Method:'''\n\n# Select the employees concerned from the list of employees<br />\n# Run the multiple action \"Copy content from function profiles\" and/or \"Copy content from employee review meeting catalog\"\n\nNote: If [[Employee review meeting|employee review meetings]] have already been agreed upon, you will need to force adding for the action \"Update content\". Meetings that were already agreed upon will be opened updated with the newly added content and as a consequence will need to be newly agreed upon.\n\n==Define requirements via general skills==\n\nAlso included in the employee file is the area \"Skills\", which will make various lists available to you to evaluate skills. These can be completed by both the employee himself or also by the supervisor. This skills evaluations provides a good basis for your company to catalog the skills of your employees and they can be compared with a \"target profile\" of each of the job profile assigned for the employee respectively. As soon as you have established the connection, a chart appears in the tab \"Skills\" in the employee file, which shows you the current suitability of the employee for the relevant job profile. If necessary, targeted development measures can also be taken as a result. \n\nAfter linking an employee with a job profile, under the \"Requirements\" tab of the relevant job profile you will see the same illustration, however this refers to the average of all of the employees assigned to this job profile. This makes it clear which further education programs would be advisable in your company. In addition, the [[Event analyses|Evaluation of events]] can also help in evaluating the effectiveness of an [[Events|Event]] and, if necessary, to improve it accordingly.\n\n==Related subjects==\n*  [[Function profiles|Function profiles]]\n*  [[Employee review meeting|Employee review meeting]]"

Changes in the event calendar may take up to 10 minutes to become visible. \n\nClick on a specific event to navigate to the [[#View within an event|detailed view]] of the event.\n\n==Search==\nYou can set different filters using the [[Search functions|Search function]], and search for specific events - or use the advanced search. This enables you to enter more detailed search criteria in the form of input fields and [[selection lists]]. <br>The different filters for the search function can be displayed/hidden in [[Configuration mode]].\n\n==Actions==\nThis section provides you with the following options:\n* [[Create event]]\n* Specify sorting for catalog: This item enables you to determine the priorities for two criteria that will be used for automatic sorting of the event catalog when it is opened.\n* [[Events#Event Calendar|Calendar View]]\n\n==Event Calendar==\nClicking on the \"Calendar View\" link in the Actions will display a calendar view. The event calendar provides helpful information about upcoming events, thus making event planning easier for event administrators. The event calendar view allows you to specify the period of time that is displayed (year, month, week or day). There is also a search field that can be used to search for events. <br>\n\nThe event calendar view can be activated in any of the following sections: \n* /CourseCatalog/Courses\n* /Courses\n* /SelfService/Courses\n* /SelfServiceTrainer/Courses\n* /Public/Courses\n\n===Visual configuration of the event calendar===\n\nYou can customize how the calendar is displayed by configuring the [[selection lists]] for events. Two examples are provided below.\n\n*You can associate specific icons with each '''event type''': \n: '''Selection list: Event type'''\n: In this selection list, a specific icon can be associated with each of the stored selection values (e.g. Lecture / Seminar / Workshop / Assessment Center, etc.). To do this, fill in the \"Special Code\" field of the selection value in question with the word \"icon-\", followed by the icon code. Standard valid icon codes / icons can be found in the following document: [https://de.onlinehelp.umantis.com/images/4/49/Umantis_Icons.pdf umantis_Icons.pdf].\n: Example: Entering \"icon-umantis-icon-9\" for the \"Seminar\" selection value would show the following icon in the calendar view before every event type that is declared as a seminar: [[File:Icon_9.png]]\n\n*You can associate color codes with each '''event category''': \n: '''Selection list: Event category'''\n: In this selection list, a specific hexadecimal color code can be associated with each of the stored selection values (e.g. Continuing Education / Training / Introduction / Course etc.). To do this, fill in the \"Special Code\" field with the appropriate hexadecimal code (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).\n\n==Applications==\nThis section lets you store user-defined links - for example, to set up an export of event schedules for [[Export appointments to Outlook|Outlook]] or [[Export appointments to Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]].\n\n==Prerequisite events==\nWithin the [[Event details|detailed view]] of a specific event, you can use the \"Prerequisite events\" section to enter events that are required for participation in the event currently displayed in the detailed view.\n\n==View within an event==\nFrom the event title, you can use the following tabs to go to event details:\n\n[[Event details|Details]] &nbsp; [[Publish an event|Publication]] &nbsp; [[Event participants|Participants]] &nbsp; [[Reminders]] &nbsp; [[Event analyses|Evaluations]] &nbsp; [[Communication regarding the event|Communication]]\n\n==Access rights depending on module and user role==\n\nEmployee management in Haufe distinguishes events in the '''Events (Administrators)''' module from those in the '''Events (Users)''' module. In addition, the assigned [[User roles in the employee management system#User roles|user role]] also influences access regulation in association with the assigned modules.\n\n; If the module event administrator was assigned and:\n\n* '''The person is also assigned the user role \"Administrator\":''' <br>Access to all events and registrations.\n\n* '''The person is also assigned the user role \"Employee\" or \"Supervisor with access to directly subordinate employees\":'''\n: If one of the following applies, the person has access rights to events and registrations:\n:* No limitation was set on organizational units for the event in question\n:* The person is the creator of the event\n:* The person was entered as the responsible administrator for the event\n\n* '''The person is also assigned the user role \"Supervisor with access to directly subordinate employees and to further organizational units\", \"General manager\", or \"HR staff\":'''<br>\n:The person has access to events and registrations. The same access rules are applicable as for employees and for supervisors with access to directly subordinate employees. If the person was explicitly entered on an organizational unit assigned to the event, this access is also applicable to this event and registrations.\n\n: Direct links:\n: - Administration of events: ''/Courses''\n: - Administration of associated participations: ''/Courses/Participation''\n\n'''If the Event User module was assigned:'''\n* The rights that are described above for user roles are applicable\n* Subordinate employees can be registered by their supervisors (\"Assign\" is only available to administrators)\n\n: '''Direct links:'''\n:* Registering subordinate employees to an event: ''/CourseCatalog/Courses''\n:* Overview of registrations for subordinate employees and, if applicable, for external individuals: ''/CourseParticipation''\n\n==Authorization concept==\nAn employee's event is saved in their Person record. This means:\nThe person with the supervisor role can see all events of his employees, including those in which an employee participated while in an earlier job. \nFor their former employees with archived jobs, supervisors can also view events in which those employees participate while in their new jobs.\n\n==FAQs about events==\n\n* '''Is it possible to automatically save two approvers as employees for the approval of an external event?'''\n: This can only be done manually, using the free-text approval field in the settings of the corresponding event.\n\n* '''Is it possible to search in the diagrams of an event?'''\n: Yes, this is possible. However, the search first needs to be [[Configuration mode|displayed]].\n\n* '''Can I make registration queries mandatory?'''\n: No, this is not possible.\n\n* '''The employee shall reimburse payment for a course if s/he leaves the company within a period of X years.'''\n: A corresponding checkbox could be placed (within an event in the \"Publication\"tab). The name of this checkbox can be defined by the user, for example \"Event must be paid back\". In addition, a certificate should be attached as a reminder that reimbursement is required.\n\n* '''Can evaluation questions be sent automatically - for example X weeks after an event?'''\n: Yes, this is possible as long as the event is active (not historicized)."

						"__text": "[[Category:Employee management]]\n\n[[Category:Jobs (employee management)]]\n\n[[File:Function_profile.png|thumb|right|465px|Fig. 1: Interaction of all elements]]Function profiles offer the possibility to group various skills and knowledge, such as leadership skills, personality, or speciality competencies, and to define them as general requirements. Several [[Job profile (employee management)|jobs]] may be allocated to one function profile, and thus share the same requirement profile.\n\nThe function profiles allocate a fixed catalogue of relevant competencies for [[Employee review meeting|employee interviews]] to all associated employees. By linking [[Employee review meeting catalogues|employee interview catalogues]] with functional profiles, which are also linked to employees, the requirements of the function profile with the characteristics of the employee may be evaluated in a targeted manner by a [[Employee review meeting catalogues#Define Scheduled Values for Skills|comparison of actual/nominal]]. Likewise, the properties of the functional profile may be used as a benchmark for the respective employee interview.<br />\n\n{|style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" class=\"wikitable justify\"\n!style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#B3B7FF\"|Explanation of the adjacent Figure 1\n|-\n\n| \n\nThe employee interview and the employee interview catalogues contain the common criteria, \"targets\", \"tasks\" and \"development goals\" for evaluation. One job is assigned a functional profile and contents of the applicant interview catalogues are copied to functional profiles as well. This way, functional profiles form a central link between all four elements.\n\n|}\n==Assigning Function Profiles==\n\nThere are two ways to assign function profiles to employees: Either via [[Imports|employee import]] or via manual assignment in the job profile in the respective employee file.\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] Behaviour when allocating a new job holder: Note, that the setting made under [[Settings for company / organization profile#Company profile in employee management|Job key is \"unique\"]].\n\n==Historicising of Function Profiles==\n\nFunction profiles change relatively quickly or are replaced by new ones. Therefore it is possible to historicise and reactivate them if necessary. You can also copy function profiles and thereby prepare a \"new, revised\" version of the function profile parallel to the existing functional profile. To do this, select the status for the corresponding functional profile \"in progress\", because this way it may still be assessed and changed by various committees before becoming effective.  If a functional profile is in progress or has been historicised, the employee import will ignore it.\n\n==Responsibilities==\n\nVarious responsibilities can be assigned to each function profile. Only responsible employees and administrators are permitted to change function profiles.\n\n==[[File:Schloss_16.png|Schloss_16.png]] Who sees what here?==\n\nWhen creating a functional profile, managers can be assigned. Then, only these may edit function profiles.\n\n'''Function profiles in the employee section'''\n\n<em>URL: /SelfService/FunctionProfiles</em>\n\nHere, all the roles see all the released function profile URL: /FunctionProfiles\n\nWho sees what: \n\n*  [[User roles in the employee management system#Administrator|Administrators]] -&gt; all function profiles\n*  [[User roles in the employee management system#HR expert|HR experts]] -&gt; all released function profiles, all function profiles in their access via organizational units, as well as all directly assigned function profiles\n* \t[[User roles in the employee management system#Superior with access to directly subordinated|Managers]] -&gt; all released function profiles, as well as all directly assigned function profiles.\n\n==Related Subjects==\n* [[Job profile (employee management)|Job profile (employee management)]]\n* [[Employee review meeting catalogues|Employee interview catalogues]]\n* [[Succession planning|Succession planning]]\n* [[Succession planning#Allocation of potential successors using the interactive search|Function profiles for succession planning]]"

Talent pools are often associated with specific development programs and exceptionally talented employees can be allocated to these pools according to their potential and career prospects. Similar to [[Succession planning|Succession planning]] for a specific job, the talent pool concept aims to ensure mission-critical skills and competencies. Talent pools also offer the possibility to assess the employees involved in pools with regard to their level of development and prioritize. \n\n'''Note:'''<br /> Since the management of the talent pool involves costs, the focus shall be on those functional areas which are critical for the company and thus are associated with a [[Job profile (employee management)#Identification of Key Positions|unfilled position risk]].\n\n<br />\n\n==Formation of Talent Pools==\n\nThe procedure for the formation of talent pools is similar to succession planning. However, the emphasis is on the functional areas and not the jobs themselves. The nomination of candidates for a talent pool can be made either manually or by using the [[Interactive search|interactive search]]. The individual participants of talent pools may subsequently be classified with respect to status (selection priority) and readiness. This classification facilitates comparability within a pool decisively. As soon as a new role is assigned to the candidate of a talent pool, the talent pool-specific development will end.\n\n[[File:Info.gif|Info.gif]] [[Competencies#Competencies vs. Skills|difference between competencies and skills]]\n\n<br />\n\n==In which fields is the build-up of talent pools beneficial?==\n\nTo define critical areas where the build-up of a talent pool is prudent and advisable, the respective [[Job profile (employee management)#Identification of Key Positions|unfilled position risk]] is determined. The risk of failure is high when the fluctuation in an area is greater than the potential of recruiting new or existing employees in this area. If additional new jobs (vacancies) are planned in this area or are still to be occupied, the risk increases. [[Employee review meeting|Employee interviews]] contribute to a better assessment of the fluctuation risk (\"Risk of leaving\") and the potential of internal recruiting.\n\n<br />\n\n==Related Subjects==\n* [[Job profile (employee management)|Job profile (employee management)]]\n* [[Vacancy notice (employee management)|Vacancy notice (employee management)]]\n* [[Succession planning|Succession planning]]\n* [[Function profiles|Function profiles]]"
